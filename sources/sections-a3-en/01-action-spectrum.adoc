== Action spectrum

Optical radiation can be characterized by its spectral distribution. The mechanisms by which optical radiation is absorbed by chemical or biological systems are usually very complicated, and are always wavelength (or frequency) dependent. For metrological purposes, however, the complexities of the absorption mechanisms can be ignored and the effect is characterized simply by an action spectrum linking the photochemical or the photobiological response to the incident radiation. This action spectrum (or weighting function) describes the relative effectiveness of monochromatic optical radiation at wavelength stem:[ii(lambda)] to elicit a given response. It is given in relative values, normalized to one at the wavelength at which the efficacy is a maximum. Action spectra are defined and recommended by international scientific or standardizing organizations, particularly the International Commission on Illumination (CIE). The weighting function may be combined with an efficacy constant relating the absolute photochemical or photobiological response to the units of optical radiation; in photometry this is the spectral luminous efficacy, expressed in stem:["unitsml(lm W^{-1})"].

In photochemistry and photobiology, optical radiation measurements may be made in terms of the spectral distribution of a radiant quantity (so-called spectral radiometric system) or the spectral distribution of a photon quantity (so-called spectral photon system); hereafter referred simply as spectral power distribution or spectral photon distribution, respectively. As the spectral power distribution and the spectral photon distribution describe optical radiation in different units, a given photochemical or photobiological effect has two efficacy constants, one for each system. Furthermore, since the spectral power distribution is not proportional to the spectral photon distribution, it follows that the weighting functions for these measurement systems are also not proportional. To avoid confusion, it is essential when using an action spectrum or weighting function to state the system (i.e. radiometric or photon) in which it is defined. There is a close relationship governing the two efficacy constants and their respective weighting functions which is described in the mise en pratique for the candela and associated derived units for photometric and radiometric quantities in the International System of Units (SI), section 1.2.

For vision, two radiometric weighting functions have been defined by the CIE and endorsed by the CIPM: stem:[ii(V)(ii(lambda))] for photopic vision and stem:[ii(V)ʹ(ii(lambda))] for scotopic vision. These are used in the measurement of photometric quantities and are an implicit part of the definition of the SI unit for photometry, the candela. Photopic vision is governed by stimulation of the cones on the retina of the eye, which are sensitive to a high level of luminance (stem:["L" > text( approx. ) 5 " " "unitsml(cd m^{-2})"]), and are used in daytime vision. Scotopic vision is governed by stimulation of the rods of the retina, which are sensitive to low level luminance (stem:["L" < text( approx. ) 10^(−3) " " "unitsml(cd m^{-2})"]) and are used in night vision. In the domain between these levels of luminance both cones and rods are used, and this is described as mesopic vision.

Other radiometric action spectra for other photobiological effects have also been defined by the CIE, such as the erythemal (skin-reddening) action spectrum for ultraviolet radiation, but these have not been given any special status within the SI.

Photochemical and photobiological actinic processes are often impacted by other factors. For example, thermal absorption may alter the actinic efficacy of radiation of a given wavelength, or optical filtering may arise due to intervening layers between the optical radiation source and the actinic layer. It is often convenient to use action spectra that combine these types of modifying effects with the actinic effect, particularly for the various retinal responses to optical radiation. Therefore, the term action spectrum can also refer to weighting functions used to derive spectrally weighted quantities based on photochemical and photobiological effects that are not purely actinic.
