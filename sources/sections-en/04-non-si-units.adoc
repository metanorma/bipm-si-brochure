== Non-SI units that are accepted for use with the SI

The SI provides the internationally agreed reference in terms of which all other units are defined. The coherent SI units have the important advantage that unit conversions are not required when inserting particular values for quantities into quantity equations.

Nonetheless it is recognized that some non-SI units are widely used and are expected to continue to be used for many years. Therefore, the CIPM has accepted some non-SI units for use with the SI; these are listed in <<table8>>. If these units are used it should be understood that some advantages of the SI are lost. The SI prefixes can be used with several of these units, but not, for example, with the non-SI units of time.

<<table8>> also includes the units of logarithmic ratio quantities, the neper, bel(((bel (B)))) and decibel(((decibel (dB)))). They are used to convey information on the nature of the logarithmic ratio quantity concerned. The neper, stem:[rm(Np)], is used to express the values of quantities whose numerical values are based on the use of the neperian (or natural) logarithm, stem:["ln" = "log"_"e"]. The bel(((bel (B)))) and the decibel(((decibel (dB)))), stem:[rm(B)] and stem:[rm(dB)], where stem:[1 " "rm(dB) = (1//10) " "rm(B)], are used to express the values of logarithmic ratio quantities whose numerical values are based on the decadic logarithm, stem:["lg" = "log"_(10)]. The statement stem:[ii(L)_X = m " "rm(dB) = (m //10) " "rm(B)] (where stem:[m] is a number) is interpreted to mean that stem:[m = 10 " lg"(ii(X)//ii(X)_0)]. The units neper, bel(((bel (B)))) and decibel(((decibel (dB)))) have been accepted by the CIPM for use with the International System, but are not SI units.

There are many more non-SI units, which are either of historical interest, or are still used in specific fields (for example, the barrel of oil) or in particular countries (the inch, foot and yard). The CIPM can see no case for continuing to use these units in modern scientific and technical work. However, it is clearly a matter of importance to be able to recall the relation of these units to the corresponding SI units and this will continue to be true for many years.
