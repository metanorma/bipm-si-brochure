This appendix lists those decisions of the CGPM and the CIPM that bear directly upon definitions of the units of the SI, prefixes defined for use as part of the SI, and conventions for the writing of unit symbols and numbers. It is not a complete list of CGPM and CIPM decisions. For a complete list, reference must be made to successive volumes of the _Comptes Rendus des Séances de la Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures_ (CR) and _Procès-Verbaux des Séances du Comité International des Poids et Mesures_ (PV) or, for recent decisions, to _Metrologia_.

Since the SI is not a static convention, but evolves following developments in the science of measurement, some decisions have been abrogated or modified; others have been clarified by additions. Decisions that have been subject to such changes are identified by an asterisk (*) and are linked by a note to the modifying decision.

The original text of each decision (or its translation) is shown in a different font (sans serif) of normal weight to distinguish it from the main text. The asterisks and notes were added by the BIPM to make the text more understandable. They do not form part of the original text.

The decisions of the CGPM and CIPM are listed in this appendix in strict chronological order, from 1889 to 2018, in order to preserve the continuity with which they were taken. However in order to make it easy to locate decisions related to particular topics a table of contents is included below, ordered by subject, with page references to the particular meetings at which decisions relating to each subject were taken.
