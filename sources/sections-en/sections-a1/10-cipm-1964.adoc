*Declaration*

The Comité International des Poids et Mesures,

*empowered* by Resolution 5 of the 12th Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures to name atomic or molecular frequency standards for temporary use for time measurements in physics,

*declares* that the standard to be employed is the transition between the hyperfine levels stem:[F = 4, M = 0] and stem:[F = 3, M = 0] of the ground state stem:[text()^2S_(1text(/)2)] of the caesium 133 atom, unperturbed by external fields, and that the frequency of this transition is assigned the value stem:[9 192 631 770 text( hertz)].
