The Comité International des Poids et Mesures,

*considering* that the rule for forming names of decimal multiples and submultiples of the units of paragraph 3 of Resolution 12 of the 11th Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures (CGPM) (1960) might be interpreted in different ways when applied to the unit of mass,

*declares* that the rules of Resolution 12 of the 11th CGPM apply to the kilogram in the following manner: the names of decimal multiples and submultiples of the unit of mass are formed by attaching prefixes to the word "gram".
