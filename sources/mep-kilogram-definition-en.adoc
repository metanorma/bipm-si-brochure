== Introduction

The purpose of this _mise en pratique_, prepared by the Consultative Committee for
Mass and Related Quantities (CCM) of the International Committee for Weights and
Measures (CIPM), is to indicate how the definition of the SI base unit, the kilogram,
symbol stem:["unitsml(kg)"], may be realized in practice.

In general, the term "`to realize a unit`" is interpreted to mean the establishment
of the value and associated uncertainty of a quantity of the same kind as the unit
that is consistent with the definition of the unit. The definition of the kilogram
does not imply any particular experiment for its practical realization. Any method
capable of deriving a mass value traceable to the set of seven reference constants
could, in principle, be used. Thus, the list of methods given is not meant to be an
exhaustive list of all possibilities, but rather a list of those methods that are
easiest to implement and/or that provide the smallest uncertainties and which are
officially recognized as primary methods by the relevant Consultative Committee.

A primary method is a method having the highest metrological properties; whose
operation can be completely described and understood; for which a complete
uncertainty statement can be written down in terms of SI units; and which does not
require a reference standard of the same quantity.

== Definition of the kilogram


=== Definition

The definition of the kilogram, SI base unit of mass, is as follows
<<bipm-si-brochure>>:

____
*The kilogram, symbol stem:["unitsml(kg)"], is the SI unit of mass. It is defined by
taking the fixed numerical value of the Planck constant stem:[h] to be
stem:[6.62607015 xx 10^{-34}] when expressed in the unit stem:["unitsml(J*s)"], which
is equal to stem:["unitsml(kg*m^2*s^(-1))"], where the metre and the second are
defined in terms of stem:[c] and stem:[Delta ii(nu)_{"Cs"}].*
____

Thus the Planck constant stem:[h] is exactly stem:[h = 6.62607015 xx
10^{-34}"unitsml(J*s)"]. This numerical value of stem:[h] defines the unit joule
second in the SI and, in combination with the SI second and metre, defines the
kilogram. The second and metre are themselves defined by exact values of the
hyperfine transition frequency stem:[Delta ii(nu)_{"Cs"}] of the caesium stem:[133]
atom and the speed of light in vacuum stem:[c]. The numerical value of stem:[h] given
in the definition of the kilogram has ensured the continuity of the unit of mass with
the previous definition, as explained in <<sec-5>>.

Details of the redefinition process are described in <<richard>>.


=== Traceability chain for mass metrology

The definition of the unit of mass does not imply or suggest any particular method to
realize it. This document recommends primary methods of practical realization of the
mass unit based on its formal definition. A primary method is a method for
determining a mass in terms of stem:[h] without use of any other mass standard
(<<fig-1>>). The mass whose value is to be determined may be an artefact, atom or
other entity although the following focuses on metrology for mass artefacts at the
highest level of accuracy. Such an artefact whose mass has been directly calibrated
by a primary method to realize the kilogram definition is called a primary mass
standard in this document. Secondary mass standards are established through
calibration with respect to primary mass standards.

The current primary methods focus on the realization and dissemination of the unit of
mass at a nominal value of stem:[1 "unitsml(kg)"]. The _mise en pratique_ may be
updated to include information on primary methods at different nominal mass values.

Primary methods for the realization of the definition of the kilogram and procedures
for its dissemination through primary mass standards are described in the following
two sections. The traceability chain is shown schematically in <<fig-1>>.

This _mise en pratique_ will be updated to take account of new methods and
technological improvements. It is not printed in the _SI Brochure_
<<bipm-si-brochure>>, but the current version is posted on the open BIPM web site at
http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/.


[[sec-3]]
== Practical realization of the definition of the kilogram

There are currently two independent primary methods that are capable of realizing the
definition of the kilogram with relative uncertainties within a few parts in
stem:[10^8]. The first of these relies on determining the unknown mass using an
electromechanical balance specially designed for the purpose. The second method
compares the unknown mass to the mass of a single atom of a specified isotope by
counting the number of atoms in a crystal, where the mass of the atom is well-known
in terms of stem:[h], stem:[c] and stem:[Delta ii(nu)_{"Cs"}].


[[sec-3-1]]
=== Realization by comparing electrical power to mechanical power

Accurate instruments that function in a way that electrical and mechanical power can
be equated had been known as watt balances, and, more recently, as Kibble balances
footnote:[We refer to watt balances as "`Kibble balances`" to recognize Dr. Bryan
Kibble, who originally conceived the idea of this experiment.]. Kibble balances can
be designed with different geometries and operated with different experimental
protocols. The following schematic description serves to demonstrate that any of
these Kibble-balance configurations has the potential to be a primary method to
realize the definition of the kilogram.

The determination of the unknown mass stem:[m_"x"] of an artefact x is carried out in
two modes: the weighing mode and the moving mode. They may occur successively or
simultaneously. In the weighing mode, the weight footnote:[In legal metrology
"`weight`" can refer to a material object or to a gravitational force. The terms
"`weight force`" and "`weight piece`" are used in legal metrology if the meaning of
"`weight`" is not clear from the context <<oiml>>.] stem:[m_"x" g] of the artefact is
balanced by the electromagnetic force produced, for example, on a circular coil of
wire-length stem:[l] immersed in a radial magnetic field of flux density stem:[ii(B)]
when a current stem:[ii(I)_1] flows through the coil. The magnet and coil geometries
are designed to produce a force that is parallel to the local gravitational
acceleration. The acceleration of gravity stem:[g] acting on the mass, and the
current stem:[ii(I)_1] flowing in the coil are measured simultaneously so that


[stem]
++++
m_"x"g = ii(I)_1 ii(B) l.
++++

In the moving mode, the voltage stem:[ii(U)_2] which is induced across the terminals
of the same coil moving vertically at a velocity stem:[ii(vee)] through the same
magnetic flux density, is measured so that


[stem]
++++
ii(U)_2 = ii(vee) ii(B) l.
++++

The equations describing the two modes are combined by eliminating stem:[ii(B) l]:

[[eq-3-3]]
[stem]
++++
m_"x" g ii(vee) = ii(I)_1 ii(U)_2.
++++


Thus power of a mechanical nature is equated to power of an electromagnetic nature.
The powers are manifestly "`virtual`" in this method of operation because power does
not figure in either mode of this two-mode experiment.


The current stem:[ii(I)_1] can, for example, be determined using Ohm's law by
measuring the voltage drop stem:[ii(U)_1] across the terminals of a stable resistor
of value stem:[ii(R)]. Both voltages, stem:[ii(U)_1] and stem:[ii(U)_2], are measured
in terms of the Josephson constant stem:[ii(K)_"J"], which is taken to be
stem:[ii(K)_"J" = 2e//h]; stem:[e] is the elementary charge. Similarly, stem:[ii(R)]
is measured in terms of the von Klitzing constant stem:[ii(R)_"K"], which is taken to
be stem:[ii(R)_"K" = h//e^2]. The quantities stem:[ii(vee)] and stem:[g] are measured
in their respective SI units, stem:["unitsml(m*s^(-1))"] and
stem:["unitsml(m*s^(-2))"]. Note that stem:[ii(K)_"J"^2 ii(R)_"K" = 4//h] allowing
<<eq-3-3>> to be rewritten schematically as

[[eq-3-4]]
[stem]
++++
m_"x" = h ({b f^2}/4) 1 / {g ii(vee)},
++++


where stem:[f] is an experimental frequency and stem:[b] is a dimensionless
experimental quantity, both associated with the required measurements of electrical
current and voltage. +
See <<robinson>> for a more complete analysis of this experiment.

All relevant influences on the mass, stem:[m_"x"], as derived from <<eq-3-4>> must be
considered for the realization, maintenance and dissemination of the unit of mass
(see also <<annex-2,nosee%>>). +
Other electromagnetic and electrostatic realizations have been proposed, such as the
joule-balance and volt-balance methods, and may well be perfected <<robinson>>,
<<shaw>>.


=== Realization by the X-ray-crystal-density method

The concept of the X-ray-crystal-density (XRCD) method comes from a classical idea
where the mass of a pure substance can be expressed in terms of the number of
elementary entities in the substance footnote:[The measurements described here were
first used to determine the value of the Avogadro constant stem:[ii(N)_"A"], which is
defined as the number of elementary entities per mole of substance. An accurate
measurement of  stem:[ii(N)_"A"] was an essential contribution on the road to
redefining the kilogram in 2018. Today, however, the numerical value of
stem:[ii(N)_"A"] is exactly defined when expressed in the SI unit
stem:["unitsml(mol^(-1))"] thus making the definition of the mole independent of the
kilogram.]. Such a number can be measured by the XRCD method in which the volumes of
the unit cell and of a nearly perfect crystal are determined, e.g. by measuring the
lattice parameter stem:[a] and the mean diameter of a spherical sample. Single
crystals of silicon are most often used in this method because large crystals can be
obtained having high chemical purity and no dislocations. This is achieved using the
crystal growth technologies developed for the semiconductor industry. The macroscopic
volume stem:[ii(V)_"s"] of a crystal is equal to the mean microscopic volume per atom
in the unit cell multiplied by the number of atoms in the crystal. For the following,
assume that the crystal contains only the isotope stem:["&#x200c;"^{28} "Si"]. The
number stem:[ii(N)] of atoms in the macroscopic crystal is therefore given by


[stem]
++++
N = 8 ii(V)_"s" // a ("&#x200c;"^28 "Si")^3,
++++


where stem:[8] is the number of atoms per unit cell of crystalline silicon and
stem:[a ("&#x200c;"^28 "Si")^3] is the volume of the unit cell, which is a cube;
i.e., stem:[ii(V)_s//a("&#x200c;"^28 "Si")^3] is the number of unit cells in the
crystal and each unit cell contains eight silicon stem:[28] atoms. Since the volume
of any solid is a function of temperature and, to a lesser extent, hydrostatic
pressure, stem:[ii(V)_"s"] and stem:[a ("&#x200c;"^28 "Si")^3] are referred to the
same reference conditions. For practical reasons, the crystal is fashioned into a
sphere having a mass of approximately stem:[1 "unitsml(kg)"].

To realize the definition of the kilogram, the mass stem:[m_"s"] of the sphere is
first expressed in terms of the mass of a single atom, using the XRCD method
footnote:[It is well known that <<eq-3-6>> is not exact because the right-hand side
is reduced by the mass equivalent, stem:[ii(E)//c^2], of the total binding energy
stem:[ii(E)] of the atoms in the crystal, where stem:[c] is the speed of light in
vacuum. The correction, about 2 parts in stem:[10^(10)] <<david>>, is insignificant
compared with present experimental uncertainties and has therefore been ignored.
Additional energy terms (e.g. thermal energy) are even smaller than the binding
energy and thus negligible.]:

[[eq-3-6]]
[stem]
++++
m_"s" = ii(N) m ("&#x200c;"^28 "Si"),
++++


Since the experimental value of the physical constant stem:[h//m " &#x200c;"^{28}
"Si"] is known to high accuracy <<clade>>, one can rewrite <<eq-3-6>> as


[[eq-3-7]]
[stem]
++++
m_"s" = h ii(N) ({m("&#x200c;"^28 "Si")}/ h).
++++


The XRCD experiment determines stem:[ii(N)]; stem:[m("&#x200c;"^28 "Si") // h] is a
constant of nature whose value is known to high accuracy and, of course, the
numerical value of stem:[h] is now fixed.

The sphere is a primary mass standard and the unit of mass, the kilogram, is
disseminated from this standard. Spheres currently used in this work are enriched in
the isotope stem:["&#x200c;"^{28} "Si"] but the presence of trace amounts of two
additional silicon isotopes leads to obvious modifications of the simple equations
presented in this section. See <<fujii>> for a more complete analysis of this
experiment. +
All relevant influences on the mass of the sphere, stem:[m_"s"], as derived from
<<eq-3-7>> must be considered for the realization, maintenance and dissemination of
the unit of mass (see also <<annex-2,nosee%>>).


[[sec-4]]
== Dissemination of the mass unit

The definition of the kilogram ensures that the unit of mass is constant in time and
that the definition can be realized by any laboratory, or collaboration of
laboratories, with the means to do so. Any National Metrology Institute (NMI),
Designated Institute (DI), the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), or
collaboration among them, that realizes the kilogram definition can disseminate the
SI kilogram from its primary mass standards to any other laboratory or, more
generally, to any user of secondary mass standards (see <<fig-1,nosee%>>). This is
described in <<sec-4-1>> footnote:[In order to preserve the international equivalence
of calibration certificates, the National Metrology Institutes having a realization
of the kilogram avail themselves of the consensus value
until the dispersion of the results from individual realization experiments is
compatible with the uncertainties of the individual realizations <<ccm2>>. The
consensus value is obtained from a statistical analysis of all the data from
available realizations of the kilogram. The consensus value is managed by a CCM task
group to ensure stability and continuity, taking all new realizations and comparisons
into account. Its calculation is described in the "`CCM detailed note on the
dissemination process after the redefinition of the kilogram`" <<ccm2>>. See also
<<stock>>, <<nielsen>> and <<annex-3>>, which all address issues related to the
dissemination of the kilogram from multiple realizations of its definition.].
Dissemination from a dedicated ensemble of stem:[1 "unitsml(kg)"] secondary standards
maintained at the BIPM, called BIPM ensemble of reference mass standards, is
described in <<sec-4-2>>.

[[sec-4-1]]
=== Dissemination from a particular realization of the kilogram

The dissemination of the mass unit is based on primary mass standards obtained from
the realization of the definition of the kilogram according to the methods described
in <<sec-3>>. All relevant influences on a primary mass standard must be considered
for the maintenance and dissemination of the mass unit (see <<annex-2,nosee%>>). In
particular, the uncertainty due to a possible drift of the primary mass standards
since the last realization must be taken into account.

The BIPM in coordination with the CCM organizes a CIPM key comparison <<cipm-mra>>,
CCM.M-K8 <<m-k1>>, for laboratories with primary realization methods. In this
comparison, the primary mass standards of the participants are compared with each
other and with stable BIPM mass standards which maintain the reference values of
previous comparisons (see <<sec-4-2,nosee%>>). The CCM decides the required
periodicity of laboratory participation in CCM.M-K8 in order to support relevant
calibration and measurement capabilities (CMCs).

In cases where compliance with the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA) is
required <<cipm-2009-24>>, it is essential that the mass standards are traceable to
primary mass standards of a participant in CCM.M-K8 that has relevant CMC entries or,
in the case of the BIPM, suitable entries in its calibration and measurement services
as approved by the CIPM. Dissemination of the whole mass scale is validated for all
NMIs/DIs and the BIPM through the traditional types of key comparisons organized
prior to the present definition of the kilogram. +
Results of all key comparisons are published in the Key Comparison Database (KCDB) in
accordance with the rules of CIPM MRA <<cipm-mra>> and may be used in support of
NMI/DI claims of its calibration and measurement capabilities and the BIPM claims
listed in its calibration and measurement services.

[[sec-4-2]]
=== Dissemination from the BIPM

In accordance with Resolution 1 of the 24th meeting of the General Conference on
Weights and Measures (CGPM) (2011) <<cgpm-24>> and Resolution 1 of the 25th meeting
of the CGPM (2014) <<cgpm-1>>, the BIPM maintains an ensemble of reference mass
standards "`_to facilitate the dissemination of the unit of mass_`" in the revised
SI. This ensemble is composed of stem:[1 "unitsml(kg)"] artefacts of various
materials which have been chosen to minimize known or suspected sources of mass
instability.

The average mass of the ensemble is derived from links to primary realizations of the
kilogram definition that have participated in an initial pilot study <<kg-p1>> and/or
in CCM.M-K8 through an algorithm defined by the CCM. The BIPM footnote:[The BIPM
operates under a quality management system (QMS) that conforms to ISO/IEC 17025:2005.
The QMS is under the exclusive supervision of the CIPM. Competence is demonstrated
through on-site audits conducted by external experts and regular reports to CIPM
Consultative Committees and Regional Metrology Organizations.] disseminates the unit
of mass from the average mass of the ensemble. NMIs, DIs, the BIPM or collaborations
among them, may adopt a similar strategy for dissemination of the mass unit.

[[sec-5]]
== Continuity with the previous definition of the kilogram

Preserving the continuity of measurements traceable to an SI unit before and after
its redefinition is a generally accepted criterion for revised definitions of SI base
units. The previous definition of the kilogram was based on the mass of the
international prototype of the kilogram (IPK) immediately after the prescribed
cleaning procedure. The dissemination of the mass unit therefore required
traceability to the mass of the IPK.


=== Steps to ensure continuity

Prior to the adoption of Resolution 1 of the 26th CGPM (2018) <<cgpm-1-26>>, all mass
standards used for the experimental determination of the Planck constant were
calibrated by an "`extraordinary use`" of the IPK <<barat>>. Additionally, the BIPM
ensemble of reference mass standards was calibrated.

A pilot study was performed in 2016 to prepare for the redefinition of the kilogram
<<kg-p1>>. The comparison included all available experiments capable of determining
the value of the Planck constant to high accuracy.

In preparation for the redefinition of the kilogram (and other units) the Committee
on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA) Task Group on Fundamental Constants
evaluated all published experimental values for the Planck constant stem:[h] by July
1st 2017 and recommended the numerical value of stem:[h] to be used for the new
definition of the kilogram <<mohr>>. The relative uncertainty of stem:[h] recommended
by the Task Group was assigned to the international prototype of the kilogram just
after fixing the numerical value of stem:[h]. As a consequence the 26th CGPM
confirmed in its Resolution 1 that, just after the redefinition, the mass of the IPK
was still stem:[1 "unitsml(kg)"], but within an uncertainty of stem:[1.0 xx 10^{-8}].
Accordingly, all mass values traceable to the IPK were unchanged when the new
definition came into effect, but all associated uncertainties of these
mass values were increased by a common component of relative uncertainty, equal to
the relative uncertainty of the IPK just after the redefinition.


=== The role and status of the international prototype

The mass values of the IPK and its six official copies are now determined
experimentally with traceability to realization experiments (see <<sec-4,nosee%>>).

Subsequent changes to the mass of the IPK may have historical interest even though
the IPK no longer retains a special status or a dedicated role in this _mise en
pratique_ <<davis>>. By following the change in mass of the IPK over time, one may be
able to ascertain its mass stability with respect to fundamental constants, which has
long been a topic of conjecture. For that reason, the IPK and its six official copies
are conserved at the BIPM under the same conditions as they were prior to the
redefinition.

== Traceability to units derived from the kilogram

[[a1-1]]
=== Coherent derived units expressed in terms of base units stem:["unitsml(kg)"] stem:[m^p] stem:[s^q]

Neither the realizations of the metre nor the second have been affected by the
Resolution 1 of the 26th CGPM. This means that for any coherent derived units
expressed in terms of base units as stem:["unitsml(kg)"] stem:["m"^"p"]
stem:["s"^"q"] (where stem:["p"] and stem:["q"] are integers), the only change in
traceability to the SI is in the traceability to the kilogram, and this has been
described above. Examples of quantities and their associated coherent derived units
are shown in <<table-a1>>. Several of the coherent derived units have special names,
e.g. newton, joule, pascal. These are not given in <<table-a1>> but they are
tabulated in Table 4 of the 9th edition of the _SI Brochure_ <<bipm-si-brochure>>.

=== Electrical units

The ampere was previously defined in terms of the second, the metre and the kilogram,
and by giving a fixed numerical value to the magnetic constant stem:[ii(mu)_0], whose
unit is stem:["unitsml(kg*m*s^(-2)*A^(-2))"] (equivalently,
stem:["unitsml(N*A^(-2))"] or stem:["unitsml(H*m^(-1))"]). The ampere is now defined
in terms of the second and a fixed numerical value for the elementary charge
stem:[e], whose unit is stem:["unitsml(A*s)"]. The fact that the Planck constant now
has a defined numerical value is of great utility to electrical metrology, as
described in the _mise en pratique_ for the ampere <<ampere>>.


=== Units involving the kelvin and the candela

The kelvin is now defined in terms of exact numerical values for stem:[Delta
ii(nu)_{"Cs"}], stem:[h], and the Boltzmann constant stem:[k]. The unit of stem:[k]
is stem:["unitsml(kg*m^2*s^(-2)*K^(-1))"] (equivalently, stem:["unitsml(J*K^(-1))"]).
The redefinition of the kilogram has no practical impact on this change (see the
_mise en pratique_ of the definition of the kelvin <<kelvin>>). Similarly, although
the definition of the candela refers in part to power, Resolution 1 has had no
practical impact on the realization of the candela.


=== Atomic, subatomic and molecular units

NOTE: This section focuses on atomic physics rather than chemistry.

The fact that adoption of Resolution 1 by the 26th CGPM (2018) redefined both the
kilogram and the mole, and that the unit of molar mass is
stem:["unitsml(kg*mol^(-1))"], is a potential source of confusion regarding non-SI
units such as the unified atomic mass unit, stem:["unitsml(u)"], commonly used in
atomic, subatomic and molecular science. The following describes the present
situation and contrasts it with the situation described in the 8th edition of the _SI
Brochure_ <<bipm-8>>. In <<a1-4-1>> we list important equations used in atomic and
molecular physics and define the quantities that appear in these equations. Of course
the changes to the SI have no effect on the equations. However, uncertainties of the
quantities appearing in the equations are affected by the redefinitions of the
kilogram and mole. <<a1-4-2>> describes these changes and gives present uncertainties.


[[a1-4-1]]
==== Equations of physics

The equations of physics have not changed. Some of the principal relations used in
atomic physics are recalled in this subsection.

The unified atomic mass constant stem:[ii(m)_u] is defined in terms of the mass of
the stem:["&#x200c;"^{12} "C"] isotope

[stem]
++++
m_"u" = m ("&#x200c;"^12 C)//12.
++++


The unified atomic mass unit, stem:["unitsml(u)"], also known as the dalton (symbol:
stem:["Da"]), is not an SI unit. Formally, the conversion between stem:["unitsml(u)"]
and stem:["unitsml(kg)"] is stem:[u = {m_"u"} "unitsml(kg)"] where the curly brackets
around stem:[m_"u"] mean "`the numerical value of stem:[m_"u"] when it is expressed
in the unit stem:["unitsml(kg)"]`".

The relative atomic mass of an elementary entity stem:["X"] is a pure number defined by

[[eq-a1-2]]
[stem]
++++
ii(A)_"r"("X") = m ("X") // m_"u" = 12 m("X") // m("&#x200c;"^12 "C")
++++

where stem:[ii(A)_"r"("X")] is the relative atomic mass of stem:["X"], and
stem:[m("X")] is the atomic mass of stem:["X"]. (Relative atomic mass is usually
called "`atomic weight`" in the field of chemistry.) The elementary entity stem:["X"]
must be specified in each case. If stem:["X"] represents an atomic species, or
nuclide, then the notation stem:["&#x200c;"^{"A"} "X"] is used for a neutral atom
where stem:["A"] is the number of nucleons; for example: stem:["&#x200c;"^{12} "C"].


In the SI, stem:[m_"u"] is determined experimentally in terms of the definition of
the kilogram. See the next section for additional information.

The molar mass of stem:["X"], stem:[ii(M)("X")], is defined as the atomic mass of the
entity stem:["X"] multiplied by the Avogadro constant, stem:[ii(N)_"A"]. The SI
coherent unit of stem:[ii(M)("X")] is stem:["kg mol"^(-1)]. For any elementary entity
stem:["X"], stem:[ii(M)("X")] is related to stem:[m("X")] through stem:[ii(N)_"A"]:

[[eq-a1-3]]
[stem]
++++
ii(M)("X") = m("X") ii(N)_"A" = ii(A)_"r" ("X") m_"u" ii(N)_"A".
++++

The molar mass constant stem:[ii(M)_u] is defined as

[[eq-a1-4]]
[stem]
++++
ii(M)_"u" = ii(M)("&#x200c;"^12 "C") // 12.
++++


These four equations relate the various quantities which are the building blocks of
atomic and molar masses and, by extension, are often applied to subatomic and
molecular masses.

[[a1-4-2]]
==== Changes of uncertainties

To discuss the implications of Resolution 1 <<cgpm-1-26>>, we begin with two
additional equations taken from the Rydberg relation of atomic physics,

[[eq-a1-5]]
[stem]
++++
h ii(R)_{oo} = 1/2 m_e ii(alpha)^2 c,
++++


where stem:[ii(R)_{oo}] is the Rydberg constant, stem:[m_"e" -= m(e)] is the electron
rest mass, stem:[ii(alpha)] is the fine-structure constant and stem:[c] is the speed
of light in vacuum.

First, it follows from <<eq-a1-2>> and <<eq-a1-5>> that for any entity stem:["X"],

[[eq-a1-6]]
[stem]
++++
h/{m("X")} = 1/2 {ii(A)_"r"("e")}/{ii(A)_"r" ("X")} {ii(alpha)^2 c}/{ii(R)_{oo}}.
++++


Second, from <<eq-a1-3>>, <<eq-a1-4>> and <<eq-a1-6>>,

[[eq-a1-7]]
[stem]
++++
{ii(N)_"A" h}/{ii(M)_"u"} = 1/2 ii(A)_"r"("e") {ii(alpha)^2 c}/{ii(R)_{oo}}.
++++


The right-hand side of <<eq-a1-7>>, which is traceable to the SI units of time and
length, has a relative standard uncertainty of stem:[4.5 xx 10^(-10)] <<mohr>> at the
time of the revision of the SI. This relation is key to understanding how the
uncertainties of stem:[ii(M)_"u"] and stem:[m_"u"] were affected by Resolution 1 of
the 26th CGPM (2018).

Of the constants appearing in the seven relations shown above, stem:[ii(M)_u] (and by
extension stem:[ii(M)(""^{12}"C")]), had a fixed numerical value before the SI was
revised by the 26th meeting of the CGPM, but no longer. The constants
stem:[ii(N)_"A"] and stem:[h] did not have fixed numerical values prior to the 26th
CGPM. (The value of the speed of light in vacuum has been fixed since 1983).

Thus Resolution 1 of the 26th CGPM has had the following consequences to the
quantities and measurements discussed above:

. Relative atomic masses (and their uncertainties) are unaffected. They are
dimensionless ratios and thus independent of unit systems. In the field of chemistry,
relative atomic masses are often referred to as atomic weights.

. Determinations of the fine-structure constant have been unaffected.

. &nbsp;

.. Neither the value nor the uncertainty of stem:[ii(N)_"A"h//ii(M)_"u"] were
affected by Resolution 1. The value of this combination of constants is still
determined from the recommended values for the parameters on the right-hand side of
<<eq-a1-7>>, and these are either traceable to SI units of time and length or are
pure numbers.
+
--
In some scientific papers published prior to the adoption of Resolution 1, the
quantity stem:[ii(N)_"A"h//ii(M)_"u"] has been written as stem:[ii(N)_"A"h(10^3)],
where the factor stem:[10^3] was used as a kind of short-hand to indicate the exact
numerical value of stem:[ii(M)_"u"^(-1)] whose SI coherent unit is
stem:["unitsml(mol*kg^(-1))"]. This short-hand arose because the mole was defined
through the definition of the kilogram combined with an exact numerical value of
stem:[ii(M)_u] equal to stem:[10^(-3) "unitsml(kg*mol^(-1))"]; but the mole is now
defined through a fixed numerical value of stem:[ii(N)_"A"], whose SI coherent unit
is stem:["unitsml(mol^(-1))"]. Nevertheless, stem:[ii(M)_"u"] may still be taken to
be stem:[0.001 "unitsml(kg*mol^(-1))"] as long as the relative standard uncertainty
of stem:[ii(M)_"u"], which is currently stem:[4.5 xx 10^(-10)] <<mohr>>, can be
neglected in the uncertainty budget of a measurement under discussion.
--

.. For no other reason than to bring clarity to the discussion in this subsection,
the changes to the value of stem:[ii(M)_"u"] and its uncertainty may be parameterized
in terms of a small, dimensionless quantity stem:[ii(kappa)]. The molar mass constant
stem:[ii(M)_"u"], instead of being defined as exactly stem:[0.001
"unitsml(kg*mol^(-1))"], as it was prior to the adoption of Resolution 1, can be
accurately derived from the last term of the following relation
+
--
[stem]
++++
ii(M)_"u" = (0.001 "unitsml(kg*mol^(-1))")(1+ii(kappa)) = {ii(R)_{oo}}/{ii(A)_"r" ("e") ii(alpha)^2} ({2 ii(N)_"A" h}/c),
++++

where, in the last term, the constants in the final parentheses have exactly defined
values.
--

Due to the principle of continuity when changes are made to the SI, the value of
stem:[ii(kappa)] is consistent with zero to a standard uncertainty of
stem:[u(ii(kappa)) = u_"r"(ii(R)_{oo} // (ii(A)_"r"("e") ii(alpha)^2))], which at
present is 4.5 parts in stem:[10^(10)]. This uncertainty would be further reduced by
improved measurements of the constants involved, stem:[ii(alpha)] in particular. The
accepted values and relative uncertainties of stem:[ii(A)_"r"("e")],
stem:[ii(R)_{oo}] and stem:[alpha] are the CODATA 2017 recommended values <<mohr>>.

The molar mass constant and the unified atomic mass constant are related by
stem:[ii(M)_"u" = m_"u" ii(N)_"A"]. It follows that, since stem:[u_"r"(ii(N)_"A") =
0], the relative uncertainties of stem:[m_"u"] and stem:[ii(M)_"u"] are identical:

[stem]
++++
u_"r" (m_"u") = u_"r" (ii(M)_"u") = u (ii(kappa)).
++++


For the case of stem:[m_"u"], whose value has been (and remains) determined by
experiment, the adoption of Resolution 1 nevertheless resulted in a reduction of
stem:[u_"r"(m_"u")] by more than a factor of 20 simply by defining stem:[h] to have a
fixed numerical value, although this improved uncertainty does not seem to have any
immediate practical benefits.

Finally, in atomic physics it is sometimes necessary to convert between the non-SI
units electronvolt (symbol: stem:["unitsml(eV)"]) and the unified atomic mass unit
(symbol: stem:["unitsml(u)"]). The correspondence is at present

[stem]
++++
1 "unitsml(u)" harr	931.49410274 (42) times 10^6 "unitsml(eV)",
++++

where the numerical value of the energy expressed in electronvolts equals the
numerical value of stem:[m_"u"c^2//e] expressed in joules per coulomb. The quantities
stem:[c] and e have fixed numerical values.

== Maintenance of practical realizations

In the past, an experiment capable of determining the value of the Planck constant
provided a result of enduring value, even if the experiment was never repeated. Now
that similar experiments are used to realize the mass unit, we discuss briefly
whether an abbreviated experiment could be used to ensure that the realization
remains valid. If we consider the realizations described in <<sec-2>>, the basic
question is: must routine realizations of primary mass standards be identical to the
first such realization? Some considerations are given here.

For realization through a Kibble balance: Assurances are needed that the mechanical
and magnetic alignments of the balance remain adequate; that SI traceability is
maintained to auxiliary measurements of velocity, gravitational acceleration, current
and voltage. Improved technology in these areas opens the possibility of reducing the
uncertainty of the realization.

For a realization through the XRCD method, stem:["&#x200c;"^{28} "Si"]-enriched,
single-crystal silicon ingots were prepared. X-ray interferometers, samples for molar
mass measurements, two stem:[1 "unitsml(kg)"] spheres for the density measurement,
and many other samples were prepared from each ingot. The spheres are primary mass
standards from which the mass unit can be disseminated, but the spheres must be
maintained in good condition for periodic monitoring by appropriate methods of the
following parameters:

* Surface layers on the silicon spheres by, for example, spectral ellipsometry, X-ray
refractometry (XRR), X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS), X-ray fluorescence (XRF)
analysis, and infrared absorption;

* Volume of the silicon spheres by, for example, optical interferometry.

These measurements are not onerous and it is estimated that they could be carried out
within a few weeks.


In addition, although no known mechanism would change the molar mass of the crystals,
re-measurement of the molar mass by improved methods could reduce the uncertainty
with which the kilogram definition can be realized by the XRCD method.

Similarly, there is no known mechanism for the edge dimension stem:[a("Si")] of the
unit cell to change with respect to time, but re-measurement of this quantity by
combined X-ray and optical interferometry could reduce the uncertainty with which the
kilogram definition can be realized by the XRCD method.

Confirmation can be provided by mechanisms of the CIPM MRA, which provide measures of
the equivalence of the various realizations.

[[annex-3]]
[appendix]
== Maintenance of mass correlation among artefacts calibrated by NMIs or DIs realizing the kilogram (informational)

In the context of the CIPM MRA, an NMI, DI or the BIPM, realizing the mass unit would
be able to calibrate mass standards traceable to their own realization only, provided
that the laboratory has participated with success in a key comparison as described in
<<sec-3-1>>. However, as long as the uncertainty of a primary realization is
significantly larger than the uncertainty of a mass comparison, the uncertainty of a
calibration traceable to a single realization would be larger than the uncertainty of
a calibration traceable to multiple realizations at least in the case of independent
and consistent results.

Laboratories realizing the mass unit might take advantage of the information obtained
in key comparisons in order to reduce the mass calibration uncertainty and increase
the correlation of mass measurement worldwide. The following simplified example
illustrates how the analysis of the key comparison might be modified in order to
achieve this.

Assume that a number stem:[n] of laboratories is realizing the mass unit. These
laboratories are labeled stem:["NMI"_1,...,"NMI"_n]. As a result of the realization,
stem:["NMI"_i] assigns a prior value stem:[m_i] and an associated standard
uncertainty stem:[u(m_i)] to a stable mass standard stem:["S"_i] with nominal mass
stem:[1 "unitsml(kg)"]. In a subsequent key comparison, stem:["NMI"_i] measures the
mass difference between the standard stem:["S"_i] and a circulated, stable mass
standard stem:["S"_"R"]. stem:["NMI"_i] reports the measured mass difference
stem:[Delta m_i], the prior mass value stem:[m_i] and the associated standard
uncertainties stem:[u(Delta m_i)] and stem:[u(m_i)].

The key comparison reference value stem:[hat m_"R"] (the mass of the circulated
standard stem:["S"_"R"]) and highly correlated posterior values stem:[hat m_i] of the
mass standards stem:["S"_i] are obtained as the weighted least squares solution to
the model

[stem]
++++
((m_1),(m_2),(vdots),(m_n),(Delta m_1),(Delta m_2),(vdots),(Delta m_n)) dot =
((1,0,cdots,0,0),(0,1,cdots,0,0),
(vdots,vdots,ddots,vdots,vdots),
(0,0,cdots,1,0),(1,0,cdots,0,-1),
(0,1,cdots,0,-1),
(vdots,vdots,ddots,vdots,vdots),
(0,0,cdots,1,-1))
((hat m_1),(hat m_2), (vdots),(hat m_n), (hat m_R))
++++

(The symbol stem:[dot =], also used in <<mohr>>, indicates that an input datum of the
type on the left-hand side is ideally given by the expression on the right-hand side
containing adjusted quantities.)

In the subsequent dissemination of mass unit, stem:["NMI"_i] uses the stable mass
standard stem:["S"_i] as reference, but with the posterior value stem:[hat m_i] and
associated standard uncertainty stem:[u(hat m_i)] rather than the prior value
stem:[m_i] and associated standard uncertainty stem:[u(m_i)].

For simplicity, the above example is based on the assumption that stable mass
standards are available. Such standards were not available in the past, and they may
not be available in the future either. However, as long as the changes in mass
standards are predictable with an uncertainty smaller than the uncertainty of the
realization of the mass unit, a procedure similar to the one described, but which
takes into account the instability of the mass standards, will provide posterior mass
values with smaller uncertainties and higher correlations than those of the prior
values.
