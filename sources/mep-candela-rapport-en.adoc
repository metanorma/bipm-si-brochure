.Foreword

The purpose of this document is to bring together the definitions and the tables of numerical values for photometry already adopted (or recommended) and published, by the Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures (CGPM), by the Comité International des Poids et Mesures (CIPM), or by the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE). This document provides the link between the definition of the candela in the International System of Units (SI) and the internationally-agreed spectral luminous efficiency functions for human vision.

The original document, BIPM Monographie: Principles Governing Photometry (1983) was approved at the 10th meeting (28-30 September 1982) of the Comité Consultatif de Photométrie et Radiométrie (CCPR), the body established to advise the CIPM on these questions.

The purpose of this 2nd edition is to update the document by adding the spectral luminous efficiency functions recently published by the CIE, i.e., the spectral luminous efficiency functions for mesopic vision and the spectral luminous efficiency function for photopic vision for a 10° field of view. The definitions of photometric units and quantities have also been updated with the reformulated definition of the candela in the International System of Units (SI) 2019 and the latest definitions of the photometric quantities by the CIE.

The 2nd edition was prepared by the joint technical committee JTC 2 (CIE-CCPR) consisting of the following members:

Yoshi Ohno (National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), USA), Chair +
Teresa Goodman (National Physical Laboratory (NPL), UK), Co-Chair +
Peter Blattner (Swiss Federal Institute for Metrology (METAS), Switzerland) +
Janos Schanda (University of Pannonia, Hungary) +
Hiroshi Shitomi (National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ), Japan) +
Armin Sperling (Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), Germany) +
Joanne Zwinkels (National Research Council of Canada (NRC), Canada).

The 2nd edition was approved by the CCPR on April 14, 2019. A harmonized document, CIE 18:2019, The Basis of Physical Photometry, 3rd Edition, containing identical technical contents, has also been published by the CIE.


== Introduction

Photometric procedures are used to measure light, i.e. measuring the universal and essential attribute of all perceptions and sensations which are peculiar to the human visual system and which are produced through the agency of that system. Thus, photometric quantities must take into account both the purely physical characteristics of the radiant power stimulating the visual system and the spectral responsivity of the latter. The psychophysical nature of the second of these two factors sets photometric quantities apart from purely physical quantities.

The purpose of this document is to describe and explain the usage of the photometric quantities as well as their units, and to explain briefly the conventions relating them with the purely physical quantity, radiant power, and its unit, the watt. These definitions and conventions aim at enabling photometric measurements to be made by purely physical methods, but to yield results that correlate adequately with visual experience. The relationships between these photometric quantities and photobiological, photochemical, and colorimetric quantities are also given. The practical realization of the units for these photometric quantities is outside the scope of this document and is available in the mise en pratique for the definition of the candela and associated derived units for photometric and radiometric quantities <<zwinkels>>.

If electromagnetic radiation is of sufficient power and of wavelengths within the range 360 nm to 830 nm (approximately), it stimulates the visual organ, i.e. the eye. The retinal receptor elements involved may be principally the cones (photopic vision, eye adapted to higher levels of luminance), the rods (scotopic vision, eye adapted to lower levels of luminance), or a combination of the cones and rods (mesopic vision, intermediate between photopic and scotopic vision).

This 2nd edition has been updated to include, in the definitions of photometric quantities and units, the spectral luminous efficiency functions for mesopic vision based on CIE 191:2010 <<cie-2010>>, as well as the 10° spectral luminous efficiency functions based on CIE 165:2005 <<cie-2005>>, and to introduce the defining constant for photometry, denoted stem:[ii(K)_{"cd"}], adopted in the International System of Units (SI) 2019 <<bipm>>.

== Photometric quantities

[.boilerplate]
=== {blank}

The photometric quantities generally used are:

* luminous flux,
* luminous intensity,
* luminance,
* illuminance.

These quantities are defined by the International Commission on Illumination <<cie-2016a>> and their definitions adopted by the Consultative Committee for Photometry and Radiometry of the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM), are shown in this section.

To avoid confusion, photometric and radiometric quantities are distinguished symbolically from each other by the subscript "`v`" or "`e`", respectively. The same subscripts are applicable to photometric quantities other than those listed above (e.g. luminous exposure). For photometric quantities using spectral luminous efficiency functions other than that for 2° photopic vision, stem:[ii(V)(ii(lambda))], the notations described in <<cls-5>> are used.

Luminous flux is the most fundamental quantity in photometry because it has the simplest relationship with radiant power. The other three quantities are defined as follows in terms of luminous flux and appropriate geometric factors. The defining relationships for scotopic and mesopic photometric quantities are formed from the formulae in definitions <<cls-2-1>> to <<cls-2-4>> below by replacing the quantity symbols by those defined in <<cls-5>>.

[[cls-2-1]]
=== luminous flux

stem:[ii(Phi)_"v"]; stem:[ii(Phi)]

change of luminous energy with time

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
ii(Phi)_"v" = {"d"ii(Q)_"v"} / {"d"t}

where stem:[ii(Q)_"v"] is the luminous energy emitted, transferred or received and stem:[t] is time


[NOTE]
====
Luminous flux is a quantity derived from the radiant flux stem:[ii(Phi)_"e"], by evaluating the radiation according to its action upon the CIE standard photometric observer. Luminous flux can be derived from the spectral radiant flux distribution by

where stem:[ii(K)_"m"] is maximum luminous efficacy, stem:[ii(Phi)_{"e",ii(lambda)}(ii(lambda))] is spectral radiant flux, stem:[ii(V)(ii(lambda))] is spectral luminous efficiency and stem:[ii(lambda)] is wavelength.
====


[NOTE]
====
The distribution of the luminous intensities as a function of the direction of emission, e.g. given by the polar angles stem:[(ii(vartheta),ii(varphi))], is used to determine the luminous flux, stem:[ii(Phi)_"v"], within a certain solid angle, stem:[ii Omega], of a source:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
ii(Phi)_"v" = int int_{ii Omega} ii(I)_"v" (ii(vartheta),ii(varphi)) sin ii(vartheta) " d" ii(varphi) " d" ii(vartheta).
++++

NOTE: The corresponding radiometric quantity is "`radiant flux`". The corresponding quantity for photons is "`photon flux`".

NOTE: The luminous flux is expressed in lumen (lm).

=== luminous intensity

stem:[ii(I)_"v"]; stem:[ii(I)]

density of luminous flux with respect to solid angle in a specified direction

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
ii(I)_"v" = {"d" ii(Phi)_"v"} / {"d" ii Omega}
++++

where stem:[ii(Phi)_"v"] is the luminous flux emitted in the given direction, and stem:[ii Omega] is the solid angle containing that direction.

NOTE: For practical realization of the quantity the source is approximated by a point source.

[NOTE]
====
The distribution of the luminous intensities as a function of the direction of emission, e.g. given by the polar angles stem:[(ii(vartheta), ii(varphi))] is used to determine the luminous flux, stem:[ii(Phi)_"v"], within a certain solid angle, stem:[ii Omega], of a source:

[stem%unnumbered]

=== luminance

stem:[ii(L)_"v"]; stem:[ii(L)]

density of luminous intensity with respect to projected area in a specified direction at a specified point on a real or imaginary surface

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
ii(L)_"v" = {"d" ii(I)_"v"} / {"d" ii(A)} 1 / {cos ii(alpha)}
++++

where stem:[ii(I)_"v"] is luminous intensity, stem:[ii(A)] is area and stem:[ii(alpha)] is the angle between the normal to the surface at the specified point and the given direction

[NOTE]
====
In a practical sense, the definition of luminance can be thought of as dividing a real or imaginary surface into an infinite number of infinitesimally small surfaces, which can be considered as point sources, each of which has a specific luminous intensity, stem:[ii(I)_"v"], in the specified direction. The luminance of the surface is then the integral of these luminance elements over the whole surface.

The equation in the definition can mathematically be interpreted as a derivative (i.e. a rate of change of luminous intensity with projected area) and could alternatively be rewritten in terms of the average luminous intensity stem:[bar ii(I)_"v"] as

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
ii(L)_"v" = lim_{ii(A) -> 0} {bar ii(I)_"v"} / ii(A)  1 / {cos ii(alpha)}
++++

Hence, luminance is often considered as a quotient of averaged quantities; the area, stem:[ii(A)], should be small enough that uncertainties due to variations in luminous intensity within that area are negligible, otherwise, the quotient stem:[bar ii(L)_"v" = {bar ii(I)_"v"}/{ii(A)} 1/{cos ii(alpha)}] gives the average luminance and the specific measurement conditions must be reported with the result.
====

[NOTE]
====
For a surface being irradiated, an equivalent formula in terms of illuminance, stem:[ii(E)_"v"], and solid angle, stem:[ii Omega], is stem:[ii(L)_"v" = {"d" ii(E)_"v"}/{"d" ii Omega} 1 / {cos ii(theta)}] where stem:[ii(theta)] is the angle between the normal to the surface being irradiated and the direction of irradiation. This form is useful when the source has no surface (e.g. the sky, the plasma of a discharge).
====

[NOTE]
====
An equivalent formula is stem:[ii(L)_"v" = {"d" ii(Phi)_"v"}/{"d" ii(G)}] where stem:[ii(Phi)_"v"] is luminous flux and stem:[ii(G)] is geometric extent.
====

[NOTE]
====
Luminous flux may be obtained by integrating luminance over projected area, stem:[ii(A) * cos ii(alpha)], and solid angle, stem:[ii Omega]:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
ii(Phi)_"v" = int int ii(L)_"v" cos ii(alpha) " d" ii(A) " d" ii Omega
++++
====

[NOTE]
====
Since the optical extent, expressed by stem:[ii(G) * n^2], where stem:[ii(G)] is geometric extent and stem:[n] is refractive index, is invariant, the quantity expressed by stem:[ii(L)_"v" * n^{-2}] is also invariant along the path of the beam if the losses by absorption, reflection and diffusion are taken as 0. That quantity is called "`basic luminance`".
====

[NOTE]
====
The equation in the definition can also be described as a function of luminous flux, stem:[ii(Phi)_"v"]. In this case, it is mathematically interpreted as a second partial derivative of the luminous flux at a specified point stem:[(x, y)] in space in a specified direction stem:[(ii(vartheta), ii(varphi))] with respect to projected area, stem:[ii(A) * cos ii(alpha)], and solid angle, stem:[ii Omega],

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
ii(L)_"v" (x,y,ii(vartheta),ii(varphi)) = {ii(del)^2 ii(Phi)_"v" (x,y,ii(vartheta),ii(varphi))} / {ii(del) ii(A)(x,y) * cos ii(alpha) * ii(del) ii Omega (ii(vartheta),ii(varphi))}
++++

where stem:[ii(alpha)] is the angle between the normal to that area at the specified point and the specified direction.
====

NOTE: The corresponding radiometric quantity is "`radiance`". The corresponding quantity for photons is "`photon radiance`".

NOTE: The luminance is expressed in candela per square metre (stem:["unitsml(cd)" * "unitsml(m^{-2})" = "unitsml(lm)" * "unitsml(m^{-2})" * "unitsml(sr^{-1})"]).

=== illuminance

stem:[ii(E)_"v"]; stem:[ii(E)]

density of incident luminous flux with respect to area at a point on a real or imaginary surface

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
ii(E)_"v" = {"d" ii(Phi)_"v"} / {"d" ii(A)}

== Photometric units

Historically the SI units have been presented in terms of a set of seven base units. All other units ("`derived units`") are then constructed as products of powers of the base units. In the field of photometry, the definition of the unit of luminous intensity (based on a blackbody at the freezing point temperature of platinum), was adopted at the 9th meeting of the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) in 1948 <<cgpm-1948>>. The name "`candela`" was assigned to this unit by the CIPM in 1949. The candela was endorsed as one of the international base units at the 10th meeting of the CGPM in 1954 <<cgpm-1955>>. The "`Système International d’unités`", abbreviation "`SI`", was established at the 11th meeting of the CGPM in 1960. In 1979, the candela was linked to radiometric quantities for monochromatic radiation of frequency stem:[540 xx 10^12 "&#xA0;" "unitsml(Hz)"] <<cgpm-1979>>. In 2018 the CGPM adopted a new approach for the SI based on seven defining constants <<cgpm-2018>>. In the International System of Units (SI) 2019 <<bipm>> the definition of the candela is reformulated by introducing the constant stem:[ii(K)_"cd" = 683 "&#xA0;" "unitsml(lm)" * "unitsml(W^{-1})"], which is the luminous efficacy of monochromatic radiation of frequency stem:[540 xx 10^12 "&#xA0;" "unitsml(Hz)"].

The frequency in the candela definition of stem:[540 xx 10^12 "&#xA0;" "unitsml(Hz)"], denoted as stem:[ii(nu)_"cd"], corresponds to a wavelength in standard air footnote:[The value of stem:[ii(lambda)_"cd"] is for standard air (dry air at stem:[15" ""unitsml(°C)"] and stem:[101325 " ""unitsml(Pa)"], containing 0.045 % of carbon dioxide by volume), see Ciddor (1996). This value changes slightly if laboratory air conditions are different but such changes are negligible in practice.] <<ciddor>> that is usually rounded to stem:[555.017" ""unitsml(nm)"], and denoted stem:[ii(lambda)_"cd"]. All wavelength values given in this document are in standard air. For photometric measurements in air under real environmental conditions, the influence of the variation of the refractive index of air on stem:[ii(lambda)_"cd"] with respect to standard air is typically in the range of a few picometres and can be neglected.

The above definition of the candela applies to photopic, scotopic and mesopic vision.

The definition of stem:[ii(K)_"cd"] relates the unit of luminous flux (_lumen_, lm) to the unit of radiant flux (_watt_, stem:["unitsml(W)"]) at wavelength stem:[ii(lambda)_"cd"]. For wavelengths other than stem:[ii(lambda)_"cd"], the luminous efficacy is proportional to one of the spectral luminous efficiency functions described in <<cls-4>>.

The SI units of the three other photometric quantities, luminous intensity, luminance, and illuminance, defined in <<cls-2>> of this document, are derived directly from the unit of luminous flux, the lumen, and the units of the geometric quantities, area and solid angle.

The SI unit of luminous intensity is _lumen per steradian_ (stem:["unitsml(lm)" * "unitsml(sr^{-1})"]), which is termed _candela_ (stem:["unitsml(cd)"]).

The SI unit of luminance is _lumen per square metre per steradian_ (stem:["unitsml(lm)" * "unitsml(sr^{-1})" * "unitsml(m^{-2})"]) or _candela per square metre_ (stem:["unitsml(cd)" * "unitsml(m^{-2})"]).

The SI unit of illuminance is _lumen per square metre_ (stem:["unitsml(lm)" * "unitsml(m)"^{-2}]), which is termed _lux_ (stem:["unitsml(lx)"]).

While the units above are defined independently of any luminous efficiency function, the corresponding quantities include the descriptor (photopic, mesopic, scotopic); where no descriptor is given, it is assumed that the quantity is for photopic vision (see <<cls-5,nosee%>>).


[[cls-4]]
== Spectral luminous efficiency functions

Photometric quantities are related to radiometric quantities through internationally agreed spectral weighting functions defined by the CIE as _spectral luminous efficiency functions_. These provide agreed representations of the relative spectral sensitivity of the human visual system under defined conditions and are normalized to unity at the wavelength of peak sensitivity. The relevant spectral luminous efficiency function is applied as a spectral weighting for the spectral distribution of the corresponding radiometric quantity (see <<cls-6>> for further details).

The most common spectral luminous efficiency functions are described in <<cls-4-1>> to <<cls-4-4>>.


[[cls-4-1]]
=== Photopic vision

The spectral luminous efficiency function for photopic vision is denoted by stem:[ii(V)(ii(lambda))]; its values are given in <<table-1>>, adopted from <<iso23539>>.


[[cls-4-2]]
=== Scotopic vision

The spectral luminous efficiency function for scotopic vision is denoted by stem:[ii(V)'(ii(lambda))]; its values are given in <<table-2>>, adopted from <<iso23539>>.


[[cls-4-3]]
=== Mesopic vision

The spectral luminous efficiency function for mesopic vision is denoted by stem:[ii(V)_{"mes";m} (ii(lambda))], and is defined as

[[eq-1]]
[stem]
++++
ii(V)_{"mes";m} (ii(lambda)) = 1 / {ii(M)(m)} {m ii(V) (ii(lambda)) + (1 - m) ii(V)'(ii(lambda))} "&#xA0;" "for" "&#xA0;" 0 <= m <= 1
++++

where

stem:[m]:: is the adaptation coefficient, the value of which depends on the visual adaptation conditions (see <<cls-6-4>>);

stem:[ii(M)(m)]:: is a normalizing function such that stem:[ii(V)_{"mes";m} (ii(lambda))] attains a maximum value of 1.


<<fig-1>> shows the curves of the mesopic spectral luminous efficiency function stem:[ii(V)_{"mes";m} (ii(lambda))] at stem:[m = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8] as examples, plotted with stem:[ii(V)(ii(lambda))] and stem:[ii(V)'(ii(lambda))]. <<table-3>> shows the values of stem:[ii(V)_{"mes";m} (ii(lambda))] at stem:[m = 0.8] as an example, which corresponds to the visual adaptation condition for a typical road lighting luminance level (stem:[~~ 1 "&#xA0;" "unitsml(cd m^{-2})"]).

image::candela/fig-1.png[]


[[cls-4-4]]
=== 10° photopic vision

The spectral luminous efficiency function for 10° photopic vision is denoted by stem:[ii(V)_{10} (ii(lambda))]; its values are given in <<table-5>>, adopted from <<iso23539>>.


=== Use of these spectral luminous efficiency functions

It is important to note that the stem:[ii(V)(ii(lambda))] function applies at all luminance levels for foveal view, i.e. for all on-axis visual tasks (where objects seen by the eye are in a narrow field of view in central vision). For visual tasks that are not on-axis (larger field of view and/or peripheral vision), the following specifications apply <<cie-2010>>:

* Scotopic photometric quantities are applicable to the condition where the eye is adapted to an average luminance of stem:[< 0.005 "&#xA0;" "unitsml(cd)" * "unitsml(m^{-2})"].

* Mesopic photometric quantities are applicable to the condition where the eye is adapted to average luminance levels between stem:[0.005 "&#xA0;" "unitsml(cd)" * "unitsml(m^{-2})"] and stem:[5 "&#xA0;" "unitsml(cd)" * "unitsml(m^{-2})"].

* Above stem:[5 "&#xA0;" "unitsml(cd)" * "unitsml(m^{-2})"], photopic photometric quantities should be used. The stem:[ii(V)(ii(lambda))] function was determined on the basis of experimental studies for photopic vision with a narrow field of view (about 4° or less). For situations where the visual target has an angular subtense larger than 4° or is seen off-axis, the stem:[ii(V)_{10} (ii(lambda))] function, based on experimental studies for photopic vision with a 10° field of view <<cie-2005>>, can be used.

For the purpose of practical photometry, and to avoid confusion, the relevant spectral luminous efficiency function used for the photometric quantities must be specified, either through use of an appropriate descriptor linked with the quantity (e.g. photopic, scotopic, mesopic) or by use of the appropriate symbol (see <<cls-5>>). If the luminous efficiency function used is not specified, it is assumed to be the stem:[ii(V)(ii(lambda))] function.

[[cls-5]]
== Photometric quantity names and symbols

The names and symbols of photometric quantities listed in <<cls-2>>, with the spectral luminous efficiency functions listed in <<cls-4>>, are defined in the following subsections. Similar names and symbols are used for photometric quantities other than those given below.


=== Photometric quantities for photopic vision

The following quantity names and symbols apply for photopic vision (using the stem:[ii(V)(ii(lambda))] function):

* (photopic) luminous flux, stem:[ii(Phi)_"v"]

* (photopic) luminous intensity, stem:[ii(I)_"v"]

* (photopic) illuminance, stem:[ii(E)_"v"]

* (photopic) luminance, stem:[ii(L)_"v"]

NOTE: The descriptor "`photopic`" is used only when quantities other than photopic are reported or discussed in the same document and there is a possibility of confusion.


=== Photometric quantities for scotopic vision

The following quantity names and symbols apply for scotopic vision (using the stem:[ii(V)'(ii(lambda))]function):

* scotopic luminous flux, stem:[ii(Phi)_"v"']

* scotopic luminous intensity, stem:[ii(I)_"v"']

* scotopic illuminance, stem:[ii(E)_"v"']

* scotopic luminance, stem:[ii(L)_"v"']


=== Photometric quantities for mesopic vision

The following quantity names and symbols apply for mesopic vision <<cie-2016b>> (using the stem:[ii(V)_{"mes";m} (ii(lambda))] function):

* mesopic luminous flux, stem:[ii(Phi)_{"mes";m}]

* mesopic luminous intensity, stem:[ii(I)_{"mes";m}]

* mesopic illuminance, stem:[ii(E)_{"mes";m}]

* mesopic luminance, stem:[ii(L)_{"mes";m}]

where stem:[m] is a coefficient stem:[0 <= m <= 1] determined by the visual adaptation level. The value of stem:[m] should be specified in the quantity name as well as in the symbol, e.g. mesopic luminous flux (stem:[m = 0.5]), stem:[ii(Phi)_{"mes";0,5}]. Further guidance is available in <<cie-2016b>>.

Note that mesopic photometric quantities follow the law of additivity only within a scene at a certain adaptation luminance level. For stem:[m = 1] and stem:[m = 0], the mesopic photometric quantities are identical to the photopic and scotopic quantities, respectively (see <<cls-6-4,nosee%>>).


=== Photometric quantities for 10° photopic vision

The following quantity names and symbols apply for photopic vision using the stem:[ii(V)_{10} (ii(lambda))] function.

* 10° luminous flux, stem:[ii(Phi)_10]

* 10° luminous intensity, stem:[ii(I)_10]

* 10° illuminance, stem:[ii(E)_10]

* 10° luminance, stem:[ii(L)_10]


=== Photometric quantities for other observers

For research purposes, photometric quantities for observers other than those introduced in the above subclauses may be used, e.g. the CIE 2015 physiologically-based spectral luminous efficiency function <<cie-2015>>, and the CIE 1988 modified 2° observer <<cie-1990>>. When one of these alternative CIE-defined observers is used, an appropriate quantity name (e.g. CIE 2015 luminous flux, or CIE 1988 luminous flux), and an appropriate symbol for the quantities (e.g. stem:[ii(Phi)_"F"] or stem:[ii(Phi)_"M"]) should be used to avoid any confusion with other CIE-defined photometric quantities. In any case, the same SI units – stem:["unitsml(cd)"], stem:["unitsml(lm)"], stem:["unitsml(lx)"], stem:["unitsml(cd)" * "unitsml(m^{-2})"] – are used and these must not be modified. Also, when a photometric quantity is expressed with photometric units, additivity must hold (at least within the stated visual adaptation conditions). Photometric units are not used for non-visual effects <<cie-2018a>>. For non-visual effects radiometric units are used.


[[cls-6]]
== Basic equations relating photometric quantities to radiometric quantities

=== General equation

For a chosen spectral luminous efficiency function stem:[ii(V)_"X" (ii(lambda))], the relationship between a photometric quantity, such as luminous flux, stem:[ii(Phi)_{"v,X"}], and the corresponding radiometric quantity spectral radiant flux, stem:[ii(Phi)_{"e",ii(lambda)} (ii(lambda))], is given by:

[[eq-2]]
[stem]
++++
ii(Phi)_{"v,X"} = {ii(K)_"cd"} / {ii(V)_"X" (ii(lambda)_"cd")} int_{ii(lambda)} ii(Phi)_{"e",ii(lambda)} (ii(lambda)) ii(V)_"X" (ii(lambda)) "d" ii(lambda)
++++

where

stem:[ii(K)_"cd"]:: is the luminous efficacy of monochromatic radiation of frequency stem:[540 xx 10^12 "&#xA0;" "unitsml(Hz)"] (stem:[683 "&#xA0;" "unitsml(lm)" * "unitsml(W^{-1})"]);

stem:[ii(V)_"X" (ii(lambda))]:: represents one of the spectral luminous efficiency functions;

=== (Photopic) luminous flux

For photopic vision, evaluated using the spectral luminous efficiency function for photopic vision, stem:[ii(V)(ii(lambda))], (see <<cls-4-1,nosee%>>), the relationship between luminous flux and spectral radiant flux given in <<eq-2>> can be simplified to:

[[eq-3]]
[stem]
++++
ii(Phi)_"v" = ii(K)_"m" int_{lambda} ii(Phi)_{"e",ii(lambda)} ii(V) (ii(lambda)) "d" ii(lambda)
++++

where

stem:[ii(Phi)_"v"]:: is the luminous flux;

stem:[ii(Phi)_{"e",ii(lambda)} (ii(lambda)) = {"d" ii(Phi)_"e"}/{"d" ii(lambda)}]:: is spectral radiant flux, i.e. the spectral distribution of radiant flux stem:[ii(Phi)_"e"];

stem:[ii(K)_"m"]:: is the maximum luminous efficacy for photopic vision, i.e. the luminous efficacy at the peak of the stem:[ii(V)(ii(lambda))] function, which is at a wavelength of stem:[ii(lambda)_"m" = 555 "&#xA0;" "unitsml(nm)"] (exactly), and is given by:
+
--
[stem]
++++
ii(K)_"m" = ii(K)_"cd" * [ii(V)(ii(lambda)_"m") // ii(V)(ii(lambda)_"cd")]
++++

(stem:[= 683.002 "&#xA0;" "unitsml(lm)" * "unitsml(W^{-1})" ~~ 683 "&#xA0;" "unitsml(lm)" * "unitsml(W^{-1})"] in standard air).
--

Other photopic photometric quantities (e.g. luminance, illuminance, luminous intensity) are calculated similarly.


=== Scotopic luminous flux

The scotopic luminous flux, stem:[ii(Phi)'], is related to spectral radiant flux by:

[[eq-5]]
[stem]
++++
ii(Phi)' = ii(K)_"m"' int_{ii(lambda)} ii(Phi)_{"e",ii(lambda)} (ii(lambda)) ii(V)'(ii(lambda)) " d" ii(lambda)
++++

where

stem:[ii(V)'(ii(lambda))]:: is the spectral luminous efficiency function for scotopic vision (see <<cls-4-2,nosee%>>);

stem:[ii(Phi)_{"e",ii(lambda)} (ii(lambda)) = {"d" ii(Phi)_"e"}/{"d" ii(lambda)}]:: is spectral radiant flux, i.e. the spectral distribution of radiant flux, stem:[ii(Phi)_"e"];

stem:[ii(K)'_"m"]::
is the maximum luminous efficacy for scotopic vision, i.e. the luminous efficacy at the peak of the stem:[ii(V)'(ii(lambda))]function, which is at a wavelength of stem:[ii(lambda)'_"m" = 507 "&#xA0;" "unitsml(nm)"] (exactly):
+
--
[stem]
++++
ii(K)'_"m" = ii(K)_"cd" * [ii(V)'(ii(lambda)'_"m") // ii(V)'(ii(lambda)_"cd")]
++++

(stem:[= 1700.13 "&#xA0;" "unitsml(lm)" * "unitsml(W^{-1})" ~~ 1700" ""unitsml(lm)" * "unitsml(W^{-1})"] in standard air).
--

Other scotopic photometric quantities (e.g. scotopic luminance, scotopic illuminance, scotopic luminous intensity) are calculated similarly.

[[cls-6-4]]
=== Mesopic luminous flux

The mesopic luminous flux, stem:[ii(Phi)_{"mes";m}], is related to spectral radiant flux by:

[[eq-7]]
[stem]
++++
ii(Phi)_{"mes";m} = {ii(K)_"cd"} / {ii(V)_{"mes";m} (ii(lambda)_"cd")} int_{ii(lambda)} ii(Phi)_{"e",ii(lambda)} (ii(lambda)) ii(V)_{"mes";m} (ii(lambda)) "d" ii(lambda)
++++

where

stem:[ii(K)_"cd"]:: is the luminous efficacy of monochromatic radiation of frequency stem:[540 xx 10^12 "&#xA0;" "unitsml(Hz)"] (stem:[683 "&#xA0;" "unitsml(lm)" * "unitsml(W^{-1})"]);

stem:[ii(V)_{"mes";m} (ii(lambda))]:: is the spectral luminous efficiency function for mesopic vision (see <<cls-4-3,nosee%>>)

stem:[ii(Phi)_{"e",ii(lambda)} (ii(lambda)) = {"d" ii(Phi)_"e"}/{"d" ii(lambda)}]:: is spectral radiant flux, i.e. the spectral distribution of radiant flux, stem:[ii(Phi)_"e"];

stem:[ii(lambda)_"cd"]:: is the wavelength at stem:[540 xx 10^12 "&#xA0;" "unitsml(Hz)"] according to the definition of the unit candela (555.017 nm in standard air).

The maximum luminous efficacy for mesopic vision, stem:[ii(K)_{"m,mes";m}], varies as a function of stem:[m], and is given by

[[eq-8]]
[stem]
++++
ii(K)_{"m,mes";m} = {ii(K)_"cd"} / {ii(V)_{"mes";m} (ii(lambda)_"cd")}
++++

The value of stem:[ii(K)_{"m,mes";m}] varies from stem:[683 "&#xA0;" "unitsml(lm)" * "unitsml(W^{-1})"] at stem:[m = 1] (photopic) to stem:[1700 "&#xA0;" "unitsml(lm)" * "unitsml(W^{-1})"] at stem:[m = 0] (scotopic)
footnote:[The subscript stem:["m"], in Roman font, in stem:[ii(K)_{"m","mes";m}] refers to "`maximum`", whereas the subscript stem:[m], in Italic font, represents a variable, referring to the adaptation coefficient.].

Hence <<eq-7>> can be rewritten in similar form as <<eq-3>> and <<eq-5>>:

[stem]
++++
ii(Phi)_{"mes";m} = ii(K)_{"m,mes";m} int_{ii(lambda)} ii(Phi)_{"e",ii(lambda)} (ii(lambda)) ii(V)_{"mes";m} (ii(lambda)) " d" ii(lambda)
++++

The values of stem:[ii(K)_{"m,mes";m}] are given in <<table-4>> for representative values of stem:[m].

The value of stem:[m] is determined from the photopic luminance, stem:[ii(L)_{"v,adapt"}], and scotopic luminance, stem:[ii(L)'_{"v,adapt"}], of the visual adaptation field footnote:[Determination of adaptation luminance in various application conditions is still in research. An interim recommendation is available in <<cie-2017>>.], and it is obtained as the solution for the simultaneous equations <<cie-2010>>:

[stem]
++++
ii(L)_{"mes",n} = { m_{(n - 1)} ii(L)_{"v,adapt"} + (1 - m_{(n-1)}) ii(L)'_{"v,adapt"} ii(V)'(ii(lambda)_m) } / {m_{(n-1)} + (1 - m_{(n-1)}) ii(V)'(ii(lambda)_m)}
++++

and

[stem]
++++
m_n = a + b "&#xA0;" log_10 (ii(L)_{"mes",n}) "&#xA0; for &#xA0;"  0 <= m_n <= 1,
++++


where stem:[a] and stem:[b] are parameters which have the values stem:[a = 0.7670] and stem:[b = 0.3334], and stem:[ii(V)'(ii(lambda)_m)] is the value of the spectral luminous efficiency function for scotopic vision at stem:[ii(lambda)_m = 555 "&#xA0;" "unitsml(nm)"]. These equations can be solved by iterative calculations, stem:[n] being the iteration step.

Other mesopic photometric quantities (e.g. mesopic luminance, mesopic illuminance, mesopic luminous intensity) are calculated similarly.

Mesopic photometric quantities should always be given with the value of stem:[m], e.g. stem:[ii(L)_{"mes";0.4} = 0.12 "&#xA0;" "unitsml(cd)"" ""unitsml(m^{-2})"].


=== Luminous flux for 10° photopic vision

The 10° luminous flux, stem:[ii(Phi)_10], is related to spectral radiant flux by:

[stem]
++++
ii(Phi)_10 = ii(K)_{"m",10} int_{ii(lambda)} ii(Phi)_{"e",ii(lambda)} (ii(lambda)) ii(V)_10 (ii(lambda)) "d" ii(lambda)
++++

where

stem:[ii(K)_{"m",10}]::
+
--

is the maximum luminous efficacy for 10° photopic vision, i.e. the luminous efficacy at the peak of the stem:[ii(V)_{10} (ii(lambda))] function, which is at a wavelength of stem:[ii(lambda)_("m",10) = 557 "&#xA0;" "unitsml(nm)"] (exactly):

[stem]
++++
ii(K)_{"m",10} = ii(K)_"cd" * [ii(V)_10 (ii(lambda)_{"m",10}) // ii(V)_10 (ii(lambda)_"cd")]
++++

(stem:[= 683.601 "&#xA0;" "unitsml(lm)" * "unitsml(W)"^{-1} ~~ 684 "&#xA0;" "unitsml(lm)" * "unitsml(W)"^{-1}] in standard air).
--

stem:[ii(V)_{10} (ii(lambda))]:: is the spectral luminous efficiency function for 10° photopic vision (see <<cls-4-4,nosee%>>)

stem:[ii(Phi)_{"e",ii(lambda)} (ii(lambda)) = {"d" ii(Phi)_"e"} / {"d" ii(lambda)}]:: is spectral radiant flux, i.e. the spectral distribution of radiant flux, stem:[ii(Phi)_"e"];

stem:[ii(lambda)_"cd"]:: is the wavelength at stem:[540 xx 10^12 "&#xA0;" "unitsml(Hz)"] according to the definition of the unit candela (555.017 nm in standard air).

Other photometric quantities for 10° photopic vision (e.g. 10° luminance, 10° illuminance, 10° luminous intensity) are calculated similarly.


==  Relating photochemical and photobiological quantities to photometric quantities

According to the present SI, a photochemical or photobiological quantity is defined in purely physical terms as the quantity derived from the corresponding radiometric quantity by evaluating the radiation according to its action upon a selective receptor. Similar to a photometric quantity, the photochemical or photobiological quantity is given by the integral over wavelength of the spectral distribution of the radiometric quantity weighted by the appropriate actinic spectrum (Appendix 3 of BIPM, 2019).

Like the action spectra for vision (the spectral luminous efficiency functions), the action spectrum for other actinic effects is a relative quantity that is typically normalized to a value of one at the wavelength of "`maximum action`"; it is dimensionless with the SI unit one. However, while specific photometric units are defined for photometric quantities, the unit of a photochemical or photobiological quantity is always the radiometric unit of the radiometric quantity being weighted and integrated. When giving a quantitative value in these latter cases, it is essential to specify whether a radiometric or actinic quantity is intended, because the unit is the same for both. Further information is available in <<cie-2014>>.


[[cls-8]]
==  Colorimetric quantities

The CIE has published basic colorimetric recommendations <<cie-2018b>> that describe the methods to be used for calculating various colorimetric quantities for a given spectral power distribution. These quantities are derived from a triplet of numbers that are calculated from a measured colour stimulus according to a specified CIE standard colorimetric system. The most commonly used system for photometric and radiometric applications is the CIE XYZ trichromatic system, called the CIE 1931 standard colorimetric system, using the CIE 1931 colour-matching functions. These colorimetric quantities and their ranges of applicability are described below.


=== CIE 1931 colour-matching functions

The CIE 1931 colour-matching functions define the colour-matching properties of an average observer (the CIE 1931 standard colorimetric observer) with normal colour vision viewing fields of angular subtense between 1° and 4° (stem:[0.017 " ""unitsml(rad)"] and stem:[0.07 " ""unitsml(rad)"]). The colour-matching functions are the tristimulus values of monochromatic stimuli of equal radiant power and of wavelengths within the visible spectrum (360 nm to 830 nm). They are denoted by stem:[bar x (ii(lambda))], stem:[bar y (ii(lambda))], stem:[bar z (ii(lambda))] and their values are given in <<table-6>> (adopted from ISO/CIE, 2007). For a larger field of view, the colour-matching functions for the CIE 10° observer (the CIE 1964 standard colorimetric observer), stem:[bar x_10 (ii(lambda))], stem:[bar y_10 (ii(lambda))], stem:[bar z_10 (ii(lambda))], are available <<iso11664>>.

NOTE: The stem:[bar y (ii(lambda))] function is identical to the stem:[ii(V)(ii(lambda))] function given in <<table-1>>, and stem:[bar y_10 (ii(lambda))] is identical to the stem:[ii(V)_{10} (ii(lambda))] function given in <<table-5>> <<cie-2005>>.


=== Tristimulus values and chromaticity coordinates

Tristimulus values stem:[ii(X)], stem:[ii(Y)] and stem:[ii(Z)] are given by:

[stem]
++++
{:(ii(X) = k int_{ii(lambda)} ii(Phi)_{"e",ii(lambda)} (ii(lambda)) bar x (ii(lambda)) "d" ii(lambda)),(ii(Y) = k int_{ii(lambda)} ii(Phi)_{"e",ii(lambda)} (ii(lambda)) bar y (ii(lambda)) "d" ii(lambda)),(ii(Z) = k int_{ii(lambda)} ii(Phi)_{"e",ii(lambda)} (ii(lambda)) bar z (ii(lambda)) "d" ii(lambda)):}
++++


where

stem:[ii(Phi)_{"e",ii(lambda)} (ii(lambda)) = {"d" ii(Phi)_"e"} / {"d" ii(lambda)}]:: is spectral radiant flux, i.e. the spectral distribution of radiant flux, stem:[ii(Phi)_"e"];

stem:[bar x (ii(lambda)), bar y (ii(lambda)), bar z (ii(lambda))]:: are the CIE 1931 colour-matching functions;

stem:[k]:: is a normalizing factor rendering the stem:[ii(X)], stem:[ii(Y)], stem:[ii(Z)] tristimulus values dimensionless.

For light sources, stem:[k = 683 "&#xA0;" "unitsml(lm)" * "unitsml(W^{-1})"] is often used, so that stem:[ii(Y)] is the value of a photometric quantity.

The tristimulus values stem:[ii(X)_10], stem:[ii(Y)_10], stem:[ii(Z)_10] for a 10° field of view are calculated similarly using stem:[bar x_10 (ii(lambda))], stem:[bar y_10 (ii(lambda))], stem:[bar z_10 (ii(lambda))].

The above equations for calculation of CIE tristimulus values have been shown using spectral radiant flux of a self-luminous object, but they are generally applicable for any spectral radiometric quantity (e.g. spectral radiance, spectral irradiance). The equations for object-colour stimuli, reflecting or transmitting objects, are outside the scope of this document; for details consult CIE Publication 15:2018 <<cie-2018b>>.

The chromaticity coordinates define the chromaticity of a visual stimulus given by its relative spectral distribution. The chromaticity can be represented as a point in the CIE 1931 stem:[(x, y)] chromaticity diagram.

[stem]
++++
{:(x = {ii(X)} / {ii(X) + ii(Y) + ii(Z)}),(y = {ii(Y)} / {ii(X) + ii(Y) + ii(Z)}):}
++++

Where stem:[ii(X)], stem:[ii(Y)], stem:[ii(Z)] are the tristimulus values.

NOTE: In the special case of stem:[ii(X) = bar x (ii(lambda))], stem:[ii(Y) = bar y (ii(lambda))], stem:[ii(Z) = bar z (ii(lambda))] the chromaticity coordinates are denoted by stem:[x (ii(lambda))], stem:[y (ii(lambda))]. They define the chromaticity of monochromatic visual stimuli of wavelength stem:[ii(lambda)] (see <<table-6,nosee%>>).

The chromaticity coordinates stem:[x_10, y_10] for a 10° field of view are calculated similarly as stem:[ii(X)_10], stem:[ii(Y)_10], stem:[ii(Z)_10].



==  General notes

The equations using an integral, shown in <<cls-2>>, <<cls-6>> and <<cls-8>>, to derive photometric or colorimetric quantities are, in practice, replaced by summations (stem:[sum_{ii(lambda)}]) over the visible spectrum. The wavelength boundaries and wavelength intervals may be those given in <<table-1>> to <<table-3>>, <<table-5>> and <<table-6>> or those matched to measured data. When it is necessary to obtain values of spectral luminous efficiency functions or colour matching functions at wavelengths intermediate to those given in the tables, linear interpolation should be used.

Luminance is intended to correlate with the perception of brightness. However, in photopic vision, it does so only for lights having the same colour. It has been established experimentally that lights having identical photopic luminances or photopic luminous intensities but different colours, i.e. different values for the chromaticity coordinates, are in general not perceived as equally bright. The brightness differences depend on the colours involved.

At present there is no agreed photometric quantity that is more satisfactory than luminance or luminous intensity for quantifying the absolute brightness of luminous sources. However, the CIE has developed a supplementary system of photometry that provides a more perceptually-relevant approach for comparative brightness evaluation of lights at any level, including mesopic levels <<cie-2011>>. This system introduces the concept of equivalent luminance and develops a photometric model to calculate brightness-related equivalent luminance using existing photometric and colorimetric quantities, by introducing a chromatic contribution to brightness that depends upon the adaptation level. The CIE supplementary system for comparative brightness evaluation is used for research purposes, to provide a measure of luminance that corresponds more closely to the visual effect when comparing two lights of different colour. The equivalent luminance values calculated using this system are expressed in units of stem:["unitsml(cd)" * "unitsml(m^{-2})"] and must always be accompanied by full details of the parameters used in the calculation (i.e. the photopic and scotopic luminances and the stem:[x] and stem:[y] chromaticity coordinates).

It is also known that the spectral luminous efficiency function for photopic vision, stem:[ii(V)(ii(lambda))], underestimates the visual response in the blue region, and an improved function, known as the CIE 1988 modified 2° spectral luminous efficiency function for photopic vision, stem:[ii(V)_"M" (ii(lambda))], was recommended by the CIE as a supplement to, and not a replacement of, stem:[ii(V)(ii(lambda))] <<cie-1990>>. The physiologically-based function, known as the cone-fundamental-based spectral luminous efficiency function, stem:[ii(V)_"F" (ii(lambda))], is based on the latest research <<cie-2015>> and is considered to provide further improvements. The stem:[ii(V)_"F" (ii(lambda))] or stem:[ii(V)_"M" (ii(lambda))] functions are not recognized by the CIPM and are used only for research purposes to measure perceived brightness more accurately. Benefits and impacts of the new luminous efficiency functions will be evaluated in the near future.
