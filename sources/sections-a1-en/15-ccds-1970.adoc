[NOTE]
====
This definition was further amplified by the International Astronomical Union in 1991, Resolution A4:

"TAI is a realized time scale whose ideal form, neglecting a constant offset of 32.184 s, is Terrestrial Time (TT), itself related to the time coordinate of the geocentric reference frame, Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG), by a constant rate."

(see Proc. 21st General Assembly of the IAU, _IAU Trans._, 1991, vol. *XXIB,* Kluwer.)
