=== Concerning the sievert (PV, 52, 31 and _Metrologia_, 1985, 21, 90)

NOTE: The CIPM, in 2002, decided to change the explanation of the quantity dose equivalent in the SI Brochure (<<cipm2002r2r2,Recommendation 2>>).

[[cipm1984r1r1]]
==== Recommendation 1
____

The Comité International des Poids et Mesures,

*considering* the confusion which continues to exist on the subject of Resolution 5, approved by the 16th Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures (1979),

*decides* to introduce the following explanation in the brochure "Le Système International d'Unités (SI)":

(((ionizing radiation)))
The quantity dose equivalent stem:[ii(H)] is the product of the ((absorbed dose)) stem:[ii(D)] of ionizing radiation and the dimensionless factors stem:[ii(Q)] (quality factor) and stem:[ii(N)] (product of any other multiplying factors) stipulated by the International Commission on Radiological Protection: +

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
ii(H) = ii(Q) * ii(N) * ii(D).
++++

(((joule (J))))
Thus, for a given radiation, the numerical value of stem:[ii(H)] in joules per kilogram may differ from that of stem:[ii(D)] in joules per kilogram depending upon the values of stem:[ii(Q)] and stem:[ii(N)]. In order to avoid any risk of confusion between the ((absorbed dose)) stem:[ii(D)] and the dose equivalent stem:[ii(H)], the special names for the respective units should be used, that is, the name gray should be used instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of ((absorbed dose)) stem:[ii(D)] and the name sievert instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of dose equivalent stem:[ii(H)].
