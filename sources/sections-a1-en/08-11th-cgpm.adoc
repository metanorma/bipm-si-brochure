=== Definition of the metre (CR, 85)

____
[align=center]
*Resolution 6*

The 11^th^ Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures (CGPM),

*considering*

* that the international Prototype does not define the metre with an accuracy adequate for the present needs of metrology,
* that it is moreover desirable to adopt a natural and indestructible standard,

*decides*

. The metre is the length equal to 1 650 763.73 wavelengths in vacuum of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the levels stem:[2"p"_(10)] and stem:[5"d"_5] of the krypton 86 atom.

. The definition of the metre in force since 1889, based on the international Prototype of platinum-iridium, is abrogated.

. The international Prototype of the metre sanctioned by the 1^st^ CGPM in 1889 shall be kept at the BIPM under the conditions specified in 1889.
____

NOTE: This definition was abrogated in 1983 by the 17^th^ CGPM (<<cgpm17th1983r1,Resolution 1>>).

=== Definition of the unit of time (second) (CR, 86)

____
[align=center]
*Resolution 9*

The 11^th^ Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures (CGPM),

*considering*

* the powers given to the Comité International des Poids et Mesures (CIPM) by the 10^th^ CGPM to define the fundamental unit of time, 
* the decision taken by the CIPM in 1956, 

*ratifies* the following definition:

"The second is the fraction stem:[1text(/)31 " "556 " "925.9747] of the tropical year for 1900 January 0 at 12 hours ephemeris time."
____

NOTE: This definition was abrogated in 1967 by the 13^th^ CGPM (<<cgpm13th1967r1,Resolution 1>>).

. the system founded on the six base units above is called the "Système International d'Unités"; footnote:[A seventh base unit, the mole, was adopted by the 14^th^ CGPM in 1971 (<<cgpm14th1971r3,Resolution 3>>).]

=== Cubic decimetre and litre (CR, 88)

____
[align=center]
*Resolution 13*

The 11^th^ Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures (CGPM),

*considering*

* that the cubic decimetre and the litre are unequal and differ by about 28 parts in stem:[10^6], 
* that determinations of physical quantities which involve measurements of volume are being made more and more accurately, thus increasing the risk of confusion between the cubic decimetre and the litre,

*requests* the Comité International des Poids et Mesures to study the problem and submit its conclusions to the 12^th^ CGPM.
