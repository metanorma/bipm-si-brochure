[[cgpm11th1960r6]]
=== Definition of the metre (CR, 85)

NOTE: This definition was abrogated in 1983 by the 17th CGPM (<<cgpm17th1983r1r1,Resolution 1>>).

[[cgpm11th1960r6r6]]
==== Resolution 6
____

The 11th Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures (CGPM),

*considering*

* that the international Prototype does not define the metre with an accuracy adequate for the present needs of metrology,
* that it is moreover desirable to adopt a natural and indestructible standard,

*decides*

. The metre is the length equal to stem:[1650763.73] wavelengths in vacuum of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the levels stem:[2"p"_(10)] and stem:[5"d"_5] of the krypton 86 atom.

. The definition of the metre in force since 1889, based on the international Prototype of platinum-iridium, is abrogated.

. The international Prototype of the metre sanctioned by the 1st CGPM in 1889 shall be kept at the BIPM under the conditions specified in 1889.

[[cgpm11th1960r9]]
=== Definition of the unit of time (second) (CR, 86)

NOTE: This definition was abrogated in 1967 by the 13th CGPM (<<cgpm13th1967r1r1,Resolution 1>>).

[[cgpm11th1960r9r9]]
==== Resolution 9
____

The 11th Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures (CGPM),

*considering*

* the powers given to the Comité International des Poids et Mesures (CIPM) by the 10th CGPM to define the fundamental unit of time, 
* the decision taken by the CIPM in 1956, 

*ratifies* the following definition:

"The second is the fraction stem:[1//31556925.9747] of the tropical year for 1900 January 0 at 12 hours ephemeris time."

. the system founded on the six base units above is called the "Système International d'Unités"; footnote:[A seventh base unit, the mole, was adopted by the 14th CGPM in 1971 (<<cgpm14th1971r3r3,Resolution 3>>).]

. the international abbreviation of the name of the system is: SI;

=== Cubic decimetre and litre (CR, 88)

[[cgpm11th1960r13r13]]
==== Resolution 13
____

The 11th Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures (CGPM),

*considering*

* that the cubic decimetre and the litre are unequal and differ by about 28 parts in stem:[10^6], 
* that determinations of physical quantities which involve measurements of volume are being made more and more accurately, thus increasing the risk of confusion between the cubic decimetre and the litre,

*requests* the Comité International des Poids et Mesures to study the problem and submit its conclusions to the 12th CGPM.
