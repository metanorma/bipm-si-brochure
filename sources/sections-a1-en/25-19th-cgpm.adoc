[cols="<,<,<"]

| Multiplying factor | Prefix footnote:[The names zepto and zetta are derived from septo suggesting the number seven (the seventh power of stem:[10^3]) and the letter "z" is substituted for the letter "s" to avoid the duplicate use of the letter "s" as a symbol. The names yocto and yotta are derived from octo, suggesting the number eight (the eighth power of stem:[10^3]); the letter "y" is added to avoid the use of the letter "o" as a symbol because it may be confused with the number zero.] | Symbol

| stem:[10^(21)] | zetta | stem:["Z"]
| stem:[10^(-21)] | zepto | stem:["z"]
| stem:[10^(24)] | yotta | stem:["Y"]
| stem:[10^(-24)] | yocto | stem:["y"]
