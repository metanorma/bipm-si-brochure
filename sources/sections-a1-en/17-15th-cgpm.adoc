==== Resolution 2
____

The 15th Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures,

*considering* the excellent agreement among the results of wavelength measurements on the radiations of lasers locked on a molecular absorption line in the visible or infrared region, with an uncertainty estimated at stem:[+- 4 xx 10^(-9)] which corresponds to the uncertainty of the realization of the metre(((metre (stem:["unitsml(m)"])))), footnote:[The relative uncertainty given here corresponds to three standard deviations in the data considered.]

*considering* also the concordant measurements of the frequencies of several of these radiations,

*recommends* the use of the resulting value for the speed of propagation of electromagnetic waves in vacuum stem:[c = 299792458 text( metres per second)].

[[cgpm15th1975r5r5]]
==== Resolution 5
____

The 15th Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures,

*considering* that the system called "Coordinated Universal Time" (UTC) is widely used, that it is broadcast in most radio transmissions of time signals, that this wide diffusion makes available to the users not only frequency standards but also International Atomic Time and an approximation to Universal Time (or, if one prefers, mean solar time), (((International Atomic Time (TAI))))

*notes* that this Coordinated Universal Time provides the basis of civil time, the use of which is legal in most countries,

*judges* that this usage can be strongly endorsed.

NOTE: At its 1976 meeting, the CIPM approved the report of the 5th meeting of the CCU (1976), specifying that, following the advice of the ICRU, the gray may also be used to express specific energy imparted, kerma and ((absorbed dose)) index.

[[cgpm15th1975r8_9r8_9]]
==== Resolutions 8 and 9
____

The 15th Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures,
(((activity referred to a radionuclide)))

by reason of the pressing requirement, expressed by the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU), to extend the use of the Système International d'Unités to radiological research and applications,

by reason of the need to make as easy as possible the use of the units for non­specialists,

taking into consideration also the grave risks of errors in therapeutic work,

*adopts* the following special name for the SI unit of activity:

*_becquerel_*, symbol stem:["unitsml(Bq)"], equal to one reciprocal second (Resolution 8), (((becquerel (stem:["unitsml(Bq)"]))))

*adopts* the following special name for the SI unit of ionizing radiation: (((ionizing radiation)))

*_gray_*, symbol stem:["unitsml(Gy)"], equal to one joule per kilogram (Resolution 9). (((joule (stem:["unitsml(J)"]))))

NOTE: The gray is the SI unit of ((absorbed dose)). In the field of ionizing radiation, the gray may be used with other physical quantities also expressed in joules per kilogram: the Comité Consultatif des Unités has responsibility for studying this matter in collaboration with the competent international organizations.

[[cgpm15th1975r10r10]]
==== Resolution 10
____

The 15th Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures (CGPM)

*decides* to add to the list of SI prefixes to be used for multiples, which was adopted by the 11th CGPM, Resolution 12, paragraph 3, the two following prefixes:

[%unnumbered]
[cols="<,<,<"]
