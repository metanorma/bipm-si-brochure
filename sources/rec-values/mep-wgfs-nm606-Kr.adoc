== Krypton spectral lamp (stem:[ii(lambda) ~~ 606" "rm(nm)])

*^86^Kr spectral lamp radiation, stem:[5rm(d)_5 - 2rm(p)_{10}] transition*

== CIPM recommended value

The value stem:[ii(lambda) = 605780210.3" fm"] +
with a relative expanded uncertainty stem:[ii(U) = 3.9 xx 10^(−9)], where stem:[ii(U) = ku_c (k = 3)], stem:[u_c] being the combined standard uncertainty, applies to the radiation emitted by a discharge lamp. The radiation of 86Kr is obtained by means of a hot-cathode discharge lamp containing ^86^Kr, of a purity not less than 99 %, in sufficient quantity to assure the presence of solid krypton at a temperature of 64 K, this lamp having a capillary with an inner diameter from 2 mm to 4 mm and a wall thickness of about 1 mm.

It is estimated that the wavelength of the radiation emitted by the positive column is equal, to within 1 part in 108, to the wavelength corresponding to the transition between the unperturbed levels, when the following conditions are satisfied:

* the capillary is observed end-on from the side closest to the anode;
* the lower part of the lamp, including the capillary, is immersed in a cold bath maintained at a temperature within one degree of the triple point of nitrogen;
* the current density in the capillary is (stem:[0.3 +- 0.1)" A" * " cm"^(−2)].

The CCDM 1982 <<docs-metre>>, <<bipm-metre>> gives

[align=left]
stem:[f_(Kr) // f_i = 1.04491924205] +
stem:[u_c//y = 1.3 xx 10^(−9)], +
using the recommended operation conditions <<bipmx2>>.

Using the recommended value of the absorbing molecule ^127^I~2~, stem:[rm(a)_{16}] or f component, R(127) 11-5 transition (see iodine at stem:[ii(lambda) ~~ 633 " "rm(nm)] and frequency differences listed in corresponding Table 1) one obtains

[align=left]
stem:[f_i = 473612214712" "rm(kHz)] +
stem:[u_c//y = 2.2 xx 10^(−11)],

[align=left]
which leads to

[align=left]
stem:[f_(Kr) = 494886516422" "rm(kHz)] +
stem:[u_c//y = 1.3 xx 10^(−9)].
