== Iodine (stem:[lambda ~~ 531" nm"])

*Absorbing atom ^127^I~2~, a~1~ component, R(36) 32-0 transition*

=== Recommended value <<ci2015>>

_f_(^127^I~2~) stem:[= 564074632.42 " MHz"]

equivalent to

stem:[lambda = 531476582.65 " fm"]

with an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[1 xx 10^(-10)] applies to the radiation of a frequency-doubled diode DFB laser, stabilized with an iodine cell external to the laser with the following parameters:

* cold-finger temperature stem:[(25 +- 0.5)"°C"] (corresponding to the iodine pressure stem:[p = 41" Pa"])
* frequency modulation width, peak-to-peak, stem:[(12 +- 1)" MHz"] for stem:[3f] detection cases;
* saturating beam intensity of stem:[12.7" mW "(+10%)] at a beam diameter of 1 mm

=== Source data

Adopted value:: _f_ stem:[= 564074632.42 " MHz"] +
stem:[u_c//y = 1 xx 10^(−10)]

|===

This value was issued from only a single laboratory under conditions where strong linear absorption at Doppler centre occurs, thereby degrading the signal-to-noise level at this high iodine vapour pressure <<kobayashi>>. Thus, the CIPM following a recommendation of the CCL considered it prudent to enlarge the standard uncertainty by a factor of seven, and round to stem:[1 xx 10^(-10)].
