== Rubidium (stem:[ii(lambda) ~~ 780" "rm(nm)])

*^87^Rb atom, crossover transition between the stem:[d] and stem:[f] hyperfine components of the saturated absorption at 780 nm (D2 transition)*

== Recommended value <<ci2015>> of the frequency:

stem:[f](^87^Rb~d/f~ ~crossover~) = 384227981.9 MHz

equivalent to

stem:[ii(lambda)](^87^Rb~d/f~ ~crossover~) = 780246291.6 fm,

with an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[5 xx 10^(-10)] applies to the radiation of a tunable Extended Cavity Diode Laser, stabilized to the _d/f_ saturated absorption line in a well characterized magnetically shielded rubidium absorption cell by the third-harmonic technique,

* cell temperature stem:[(22.5 +- 1)"°C"]
* frequency modulation width, peak-to-peak, stem:[(5 +- 1)" "rm(MHz)];
* saturating beam intensity of stem:[(120 +- 20)" "rm(mW)" "rm(cm)^(-2)]

== Source data

Adopted value:: stem:[f = 384227981.9 " "rm(MHz)] +
stem:[u_c//y = 5 xx 10^(-10)]

calculated from

| stem:[384227981867.8 (165)] | stem:[4.3 xx 10^(−10)] | <<bitou>>

as a weighted mean. The fractional uncertainty was evaluated to be approximately stem:[4.3 xx 10^(−10)] for a 0.01 s averaging time <<bitou>>. For the recommendation this uncertainty was rounded to stem:[5 xx 10^(−10)].
