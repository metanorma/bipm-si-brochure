*stem:["&#x200c;"^{199} "Hg"] neutral atom, stem:[6"s"^2" &#x200c;"^1"S"_0 - 6"s"6"p"" "^3"P"_0] unperturbed optical transition*

== Recommended value <<cctf22>> of the frequency in the CIPM List of Frequencies

stem:[f("&#x200c;"^{199} "Hg") = 1128575290808154.32 "unitsml(Hz)"]

equivalent to

stem:[ii(lambda)("&#x200c;"^{199} "Hg") = 265637977.75983897 "unitsml(fm)"],

with a relative standard uncertainty of stem:[2.4 xx 10^(-16)].

This radiation was endorsed by the CCTF as a secondary representation of the
definition of the second <<cctf21>>.

== Method to establish the recommended value

A global adjustment of all measurements of frequency ratios published in
peer-reviewed publications and available to the CCL-CCTF WGFS was carried out
following the methods presented in <<margolis;to!riehle>>.

This adjustment determines the frequency of 14 transitions (see <<fig1>>) which are
either already adopted as secondary representations of the second <<riehle>> or
considered as candidates for SRS. It took into account 105 measurements, including 33
frequency ratios and 72 absolute frequency measurements (i.e. ratios to the
stem:["&#x200c;"^{133} "Cs"] frequency). A total of 483 correlations between these
input measurements were estimated and considered in the adjustment. More details on
the input data and the processing are provided at
https://webtai.bipm.org/ftp/pub/tai/publication/wgfs/Adjustment_2021.html . The
recommended value is the direct result of the adjustment, rounded as deemed adequate
with respect to the recommended uncertainty.

While the results are from a global adjustment, it is of interest to note (see
<<fig1>>) that the stem:["&#x200c;"^{199} "Hg"] transition is involved in 2
measurements relative to stem:["&#x200c;"^{133} "Cs"], and in 4 frequency ratios, 3
of which are with optical transitions.
