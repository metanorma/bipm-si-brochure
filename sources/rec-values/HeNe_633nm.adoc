== Helium Neon Laser (unstabilized) (stem:[f ~~ 474" THz"])

*HeNe laser operating on the stem:[3s_2 -> 2p_4] transition*

=== CIPM recommended value <<ci2007>> of the frequency

stem:[f(HeNe_("unstabilised"))= 473.612" "7" THz"]

equivalent to

stem:[lambda(HeNe_("unstabilised"))= 632.990" "8" nm"] 

with a relative standard uncertainty of stem:[1.5 xx 10^(-6)] applies apply to the radiation in vacuum of an unstabilized helium-neon laser operating solely on the stem:[3s_2 -> 2p_4] transition, independent of the isotopic mixture of the neon.

*This wavelength (in vacuum) value was also recommended by CIPM 2007 as a Realization of the Definition of the Metre*

=== Source data

The source data are derived from an investigation carried out by the CCL and published in <<stone>>
