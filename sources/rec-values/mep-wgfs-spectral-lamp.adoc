For ^86^Kr, the above values with a relative expanded uncertainty stem:[ii(U) = 2 xx 10^(−8)], where stem:[ii(U) = ku_c" "(k = 3)], apply to radiations emitted by a hot-cathode discharge lamp containing ^86^Kr, of a purity not less than 99 %, in sufficient quantity to assure the presence of solid krypton at a temperature of 64 K, this lamp having a capillary with an inner diameter from 2 mm to 4 mm and a wall thickness of about 1 mm.

It is estimated that the wavelength of the radiation emitted by the positive column is equal, to within 1 part in stem:[10^8], to the wavelength corresponding to the transition between the unperturbed levels, when the following conditions are satisfied:

* the capillary is observed end-on from the side closest to the anode;
* the lower part of the lamp, including the capillary, is immersed in a cold bath maintained at a temperature within one degree of the triple point of nitrogen;
* the current density in the capillary is stem:[(0.3 +- 0.1)" A "*" cm"^(−2)].

For ^198^Hg, the above values with a relative expanded uncertainty stem:[ii(U) = 5 xx 10^(−8)], where stem:[ii(U) = ku_c" "(k = 3)], apply to radiations emitted by a discharge lamp when the following conditions are met:

* the radiations are produced using a discharge lamp without electrodes containing ^198^Hg, of a purity not less than 98 %, and argon at a pressure from 0.5 mm Hg to 1.0 mm Hg (66 Pa to 133 Pa);
* the internal diameter of the capillary of the lamp is about 5 mm, and the radiation is observed transversely;
* the lamp is excited by a high-frequency field at a moderate power and is maintained at a temperature less than 10 °C;
* it is preferred that the volume of the lamp be greater than stem:[20" "rm(cm)^3].

For ^114^Cd, the above values with a relative expanded uncertainty stem:[ii(U) = 7 xx 10^(−8)], where stem:[ii(U) = ku_c" "(k = 3)], apply to radiations emitted by a discharge lamp under the following conditions:

* the radiations are generated using a discharge lamp without electrodes, containing ^114^Cd of a purity not less than 95 %, and argon at a pressure of about 1 mm Hg (133 Pa) at ambient temperature;
* the internal diameter of the capillary of the lamp is about 5 mm, and the radiation is observed transversely;
* the lamp is excited by a high-frequency field at a moderate power and is maintained at a temperature such that the green line is not reversed.
