For ^86^Kr, the above values with a relative expanded uncertainty stem:[ii(U) = 2 xx 10^(−8)], where stem:[ii(U) = ku_c" "(k = 3)], apply to radiations emitted by a hot-cathode discharge lamp containing ^86^Kr, of a purity not less than 99 %, in sufficient quantity to assure the presence of solid krypton at a temperature of stem:[64 "unitsml(K)"], this lamp having a capillary with an inner diameter from stem:[2 "unitsml(mm)"] to stem:[4 "unitsml(mm)"] and a wall thickness of about stem:[1 "unitsml(mm)"].

It is estimated that the wavelength of the radiation emitted by the positive column is equal, to within 1 part in stem:[10^8], to the wavelength corresponding to the transition between the unperturbed levels, when the following conditions are satisfied:

* the capillary is observed end-on from the side closest to the anode;
* the lower part of the lamp, including the capillary, is immersed in a cold bath maintained at a temperature within one degree of the triple point of nitrogen;
* the current density in the capillary is stem:[(0.3 +- 0.1) "unitsml(A)"*"unitsml(cm^(-2))"].

For ^198^Hg, the above values with a relative expanded uncertainty stem:[ii(U) = 5 xx 10^(−8)], where stem:[ii(U) = ku_c" "(k = 3)], apply to radiations emitted by a discharge lamp when the following conditions are met:

* the radiations are produced using a discharge lamp without electrodes containing ^198^Hg, of a purity not less than 98 %, and argon at a pressure from stem:[0.5 "unitsml(mm)"] Hg to stem:[1.0 "unitsml(mm)"] Hg (stem:[66 "unitsml(Pa)"] to stem:[133 "unitsml(Pa)"]);
* the internal diameter of the capillary of the lamp is about stem:[5 "unitsml(mm)"], and the radiation is observed transversely;
* the lamp is excited by a high-frequency field at a moderate power and is maintained at a temperature less than stem:[10 "unitsml(degC)"];
* it is preferred that the volume of the lamp be greater than stem:[20 "unitsml(cm^3)"].

For ^114^Cd, the above values with a relative expanded uncertainty stem:[ii(U) = 7 xx 10^(−8)], where stem:[ii(U) = ku_c" "(k = 3)], apply to radiations emitted by a discharge lamp under the following conditions:

* the radiations are generated using a discharge lamp without electrodes, containing ^114^Cd of a purity not less than 95 %, and argon at a pressure of about stem:[1 "unitsml(mm)"] Hg (stem:[133 "unitsml(Pa)"]) at ambient temperature;
* the internal diameter of the capillary of the lamp is about stem:[5 "unitsml(mm)"], and the radiation is observed transversely;
* the lamp is excited by a high-frequency field at a moderate power and is maintained at a temperature such that the green line is not reversed.
