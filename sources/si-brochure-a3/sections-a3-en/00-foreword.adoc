Optical radiation is able to cause chemical changes in certain living or non-living materials: this property is called actinism, and radiation capable of causing such changes is referred to as actinic radiation. Actinic radiation has the fundamental characteristic that, at the molecular level, one photon interacts with one molecule to alter or break the molecule into new molecular species. In addition, optical radiation at infrared wavelengths is able to cause thermal damage to living or non-living materials at high exposure levels, although in this case the interaction is not at the single photon level. These interactions between incident optical radiation and the material being irradiated can be described by defining specific photochemical or photobiological quantities in terms of the result of optical radiation on the material in question and the associated chemical or biological receptors.

In the field of metrology, the only photobiological quantity which has been formally defined for measurement in the SI relates to the interaction of light with the human eye in vision. An SI base unit, the candela, has been defined for this important photobiological quantity. Several other photometric quantities with units derived from the candela have also been defined (such as the lumen and the lux, see Table 4 in section 2.3.4).

Marginal note: The definition of photometric quantities and units can be found in the _ILV: International Lighting Vocabulary_, CIE publication S 017/E:2011 or in the _International Electrotechnical Vocabulary_, IEC publication 60050 (IEV), chapter 845: Lighting. The practical realization of these definitions can be found in the _mise-en-pratique_ for the candela, and further details of the basic conventions and how to apply these definitions can be found in the joint BIPM/CIE technical report CIE 018 and the joint ISO/CIE standard ISO 23539 CIE S 010 _Photometry â€“ The CIE system of physical photometry_.
