== Overview

The purpose of this document is to develop CCL/WG-N guidance for the use of monoatomic
steps of crystalline silicon surfaces as a pathway for traceability to the SI unit of
metre for dimensional, molecular and biological applications at the nanoscale. Most of
the work described here is an outcome of the European Metrology Research Programme
Project Crystal <<euramet>>.


== Current state of the art for step height calibration standards

High precision displacement metrology is used in so-called metrological atomic force
microscopes (MAFMs) for the calibration of 1D and 2D grating standards in the micrometre
and nanometre range. In particular, for AFMs with larger scanning ranges measuring over
a large number of identical grating structures, the achievable uncertainties for mean
pitch measurements are in the picometre range. However, measurements of distance between
two lateral positions or between two planes separated vertically (step height) is
limited to sub-nanometre uncertainty. Contributions arise from the non-linearity of the
displacement interferometer, the Abbe offset, the surface roughness, waviness or
probe-sample interactions. The smallest step height realized in a commercially available
step height standard based on a silicon dioxide (stem:["SiO"_2]) layer on silicon
(stem:["Si"]) is in the range of stem:[6 "unitsml(nm)"]. However, the uncertainty of
such stem:["SiO"_2//"Si"] step height standards is rather large with stem:[u(k = 1)]
around stem:[0.5 "unitsml(nm)"] <<wgdm>>, compared to the resolution of the AFM.
Therefore, the available uncertainty for step height standards currently limits the
achievable measurement uncertainty for height measurements of features of interest in
clearly resolved AFM images of _for example_, single-walled and multi-walled carbon
nanotubes, (SW-CNT, MW-CNT), molecules, Bucky balls, polymers, thin films and DNA lying
on flat surfaces.

There is therefore a need for new standards to overcome this limit. Standards which show
finer steps or structures, and whose size can be related to a natural constant with a
small uncertainty are needed. Crystalline surfaces have both, a fixed distance between
atoms in the surface of a given crystallographic orientation, a so-called natural
constant, and in vertical direction steps between sets of crystallographic planes. The
spacings between monoatomic steps formed from families of crystallographic planes are in
the useful range between stem:[0.1 "unitsml(nm)"] to stem:[0.3 "unitsml(nm)"]. The
specific emphasis of this document is on the use of monocrystalline silicon with
surfaces with stem:["{111}"] and stem:["{100}"] orientation as a metrological reference
for height measurement of localized nanostructures. Note that in surface science
investigations refer to the stem:["(001)"] orientation, whereas in the semiconductor
industry reference is made to the stem:["(100)"] plane, but from the point of view of
this document, they are equivalent. The height of monoatomic steps can be traced back to
distances between atoms in the bulk crystal in the same direction. However, the most
critical point is to assign to such a step height a realistic measurement uncertainty
taking into account some special conditions related to surfaces.


== Experience

=== Background - the bulk value of stem:["Si"] unit cell stem:[d_{220}]

The lattice constant of silicon has been determined on bulk silicon crystals with very
small uncertainty down to stem:[10^(-8)] or less by using optical interferometry
combined with x-ray interferometry <<andreas>>. Up to now all of the measurements
performed are in good agreement <<mohr>>. For measurement in the nanometre region alone,
the stem:["Si"] lattice spacing can be regarded as a natural constant <<andreas>> with a
known uncertainty.


=== Crystalline surfaces under UHV conditions

Clean crystalline surfaces, _i.e._ free of oxygen and other contamination,
can be produced under ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) conditions. Under such conditions the atoms
of the clean surface can relax or
reconstruct themselves, because there are no atoms above them, which would constrain the
atoms to
the normal positions in a bulk lattice _i.e._ multiples of the unit cell configurations.
Therefore, surface
atoms arrange in a periodic manner to build a so-called surface unit cell, which is
representative for the whole ideal surface.

Therefore, it is reasonable to investigate the real/true value of the lattice distance at surfaces in both
directions, laterally and vertically. Atoms on a clean surface in UHV have free electron bonds, which
are energetically unfavourable. This condition can be improved by a rearrangement or reconstruction
of the atoms on the surface layer. On the other hand, this could introduce some stress or strain
between surface layers and the bulk crystal, thereby affecting the lattice spacing at the surface.

After removal of the native oxide by heating in UHV, and in the case of stem:["Si"]
surfaces the stem:[(111)] shows a
stem:[7 xx 7] reconstruction). '`stem:[7 xx 7]`' means that in each direction the
surface unit cell is a factor of stem:[7] larger than
it would be estimated from the bulk value. Here six adatoms building the upmost surface
layer reduces
the number of free bonds of the underlying stem:["Si"]-atoms as shown in <<fig-1,nopage%>>.


[[fig-1]]
.Image of the stem:["Si(111)"] stem:[7 xx 7] surface as obtained by STM into the unfilled states of the stem:["Si"] surface. The size of the unit cell is indicated.
image::fig1.png[]


In this image only the adatoms lying on the surface are shown, which can be detected by scanning
tunnelling microscopy (STM) <<binnig>> and atomic force microscopy (AFM) <<giessibl>>.
Beyond this layer, the atoms
are arranged in the stem:[7 xx 7] structure, including a stacking fault. The whole
stem:[7 xx 7] surface unit cell of stem:["Si(111)"]
is explained by the DAS model <<takayanagi>> <<qian>>. If the stem:["Si(111)"] surface
is carefully prepared in UHV, the same
arrangement of atoms is obtained on all terraces which also are separated by a
monoatomic step or
multiple steps. Therefore, the terraces are physically identical and the step heights
between successive
terraces are either identical or multiples of the lattice spacing.

In the case of the stem:["Si(100)"] surface, two nearby atoms share the electrons in the
form of dimers. The
surface unit cell is a stem:[2 xx 1], the direction of the dimers changes from terrace
to terrace (see <<fig-2,nopage%>>) by stem:[90 "unitsml(deg)"].

image::fig2.png[]


Steps are created in the annealing process to remove the oxygen layer on the top
surface. The number of steps formed is arbitrary and depends on misorientation of the
prepared surface with respect to the crystallographic planes and the annealing process.
Direct current heating of a sample can induce step bunching if the electric field is
applied in the wrong direction <<homma>> <<yang>>. Nevertheless, owing to symmetry
considerations, the first estimate of the spacing between two successive surface lattice
planes must be close to the bulk value, _i.e._ stem:[d_{111} = 0.313 "unitsml(nm)"] for
stem:["Si(111)"] and stem:[d_{100} = 0.134 "unitsml(nm)"] for stem:["Si(100)"] surfaces
(<<fig-3,nopage%>>).


[[fig-3]]

image::fig3.png[]

Under UHV conditions the step of a clean stem:["Si(111)"]-stem:[7 xx 7] surface is used
for validation of the calibration of piezo actuators in high-resolution instruments,
such as STM and AFM. However, for this step height a larger uncertainty must be taken
into account than in the case of lattice planes in the bulk crystal owing to effects
caused by the rearrangement of atoms at surfaces and stress or strain effects.


=== Preparation of atomically flat regions and monoatomic steps on stem:["Si(111)"] in UHV

Several groups have investigated the preparation of nearly step-free surfaces on
stem:["Si"] wafers <<hibino>> <<tanaka>>. Homma _et al._ <<hibino>> have presented a
method based on a pre-structured stem:["Si(111)"] wafer. Square shaped craters with
stem:[150 xx 150 "unitsml(um^2)"] in size and an initial depth of stem:[1 "unitsml(um)"]
were etched in the silicon surface. Afterwards an annealing under UHV conditions formed
single atomic steps within the pre-structured craters. The surfaces were investigated
using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). A temperature-dependence of step spacing was
found and could make the contrast between stem:[7 xx 7] and stem:[1 xx 1] reconstructed
areas clearly visible. The largest step-free areas were terraces with a width of
approximately stem:[30 "unitsml(um)"]. Blakely and his co-workers have done similar
experiments and also investigated the change of the morphology of stepped surfaces due
to oxidation with AFM <<oliver>>. They found that the oxidation of stem:["Si"], _i.e._
the change of the stem:["Si"] surface to stem:["SiO"_2], does not change the steps. They
assume that the oxidation of stem:["Si"] is dominated by a lateral growing. Fissel _et
al._ <<fissel>> have presented a method to prepare large step-free areas on
pre-structured plateaus on a stem:["Si(111)"] wafer surface. They have used molecular
beam epitaxy (MBE) as a silicon growing process to smooth the surface of different sized
plateaus from stem:[8 xx 8 "unitsml(um^2)"] up to stem:[15 xx 15 "unitsml(um^2)"].
Depending on the temperature during silicon growth they obtained either complete
step-free areas or areas with several single steps. A closer examination of a prepared
step-free surface using an AFM has sometimes revealed surface artefacts; triangular
voids and islands with a lateral width of stem:[100 "unitsml(nm)"] and a depth, or
height respectively, of just one atomic silicon bilayer.

Other groups have worked on stem:["Si(100)"] surfaces which are also pre-structured with
2D-patterns based on etched grating structures or etched trenches to prepare single
atomic steps <<li>> <<ignatescu>>.

By improved preparation techniques, recently <<ignatescu>> also larger step-free areas
on stem:["Si(111)"] surfaces could be realized, see <<fig-4>>.


[[fig-4]]
.Optical images of a) a step-free region, b) staircase and c) amphitheatre-like arranged steps.
image::fig4.png[]


These images are obtained by a special procedure using laser-scanning confocal
microscopy (LSCM) to get a quick overview of interesting parts of the sample.
Additionally, such selected regions of the samples have been checked by AFM to validate
step-free and undisturbed monoatomic step regions.

In the following section, the main features of the production of atomic terraced
surfaces are described. The essential process steps are defined and described, but
without in-depth details of the technical and plant-specific production process. This
process results in larger step-free regions of about stem:[100 "unitsml(um)"] in size,
in regions with terraces in the micrometre range separated by monoatomic steps in a
staircase or in an amphitheatre-like structure. A corresponding detailed description of
the production can be found, for example, in <<busch>>. Therein more details are given
about deviation which occurs due to insufficient preparation of the stem:["Si"] surface.
This includes two procedures for the calibration of instruments by using stem:["Si"]
monoatomic steps as indicated in <<fig-5>>. More details are given in <<garnaes>>.

<<fig-5>> shows in detail the so-called amphitheatre structure. It is essential for the
improvement of calibrations of the vertical axis of AFMs due to the underlying crystal
structure of the terraces. All areas of a terrace are on one level. Therefore, the
orientation of the AFMs can be significantly improved during measurement and evaluation.

== Practical Implementation

=== Preparation of stem:["Si(111)"] samples with monoatomic steps and step-free regions

The aim of producing atomically smooth or atomically stepped surfaces is to continue the
single crystal structure present in the underlying crystalline bulk crystal to the
surface without interference. The starting point is therefore a monocrystalline silicon
wafer with the desired mesh plane at the cut surface. In the following, the
stem:["Si(111)"] mesh plane is considered. The starting material should have a miscut
angle as close as possible to zero footnote:[Due to production limitations, even wafers
with miscut angle of stem:[0 "unitsml(deg)"] have a remaining misalignment of a few
arcminutes with random orientation. However, this is negligible for the manufacturing
process.] and should have a low doping concentration. The crystal lattice in the volume
of the wafer is undisturbed and with the use of high-quality starting materials,
large-scale crystal defects such as dislocations, swirls, etc. can be ruled out. The
concentration of
localized crystal defects, such as voids, interstitial atoms, foreign atoms is so low in
the wafer qualities available on the market that they can be neglected for further
processing.

=== Sample preparation

The following five process steps are required for the preparation of suitable samples:

. Thermal oxidation
. Lithography for lateral structuring
. [[st3]] Sample cleaning
. [[st4]] Annealing in UHV
. Optical characterization

The first two steps are for general sample preparation.

The second part of the production (steps <<st3>> and <<st4>>) is then used directly to
generate the sub-nanometre steps in a self-organized process, _i.e._ the undisturbed
continuation of the bulk crystal lattice up to the sample surface is achieved by a
combined diffusion and attachment process of silicon atoms to the underlying crystal
lattice.

During the various process steps, rigorous quality management must ensure that no
contamination of the samples occurs. In particular, contamination with nanoparticles
must be avoided as they cannot be removed without damage to the sample surface.
<<fig-6>> shows an example of a stem:["Si"] surface with a pattern, the sample during
annealing and the image obtained by LSCM on an annealed pattern on the stem:["Si(111)"]
surface.

image::fig6.png[]


*1: Oxidation*

An oxide layer is needed to produce pits of the desired size in which at the bottom, an
oxygen-free surface can be generated and on which diffusion of stem:["Si"] atoms is
possible. Native silicon dioxide on typical wafer is too thin to act as thermal
protection layer for the sample. Therefore, a thicker thermal oxide layer has to be
grown on the surface, because the melting point for stem:["SiO"_2] is much higher than
for stem:["Si"]. The thickness of the oxide layer should be at least stem:[100
"unitsml(nm)"]. Good experiences are obtained with a stem:[300 "unitsml(nm)"]
stem:["SiO"_2] layer. The smallest lateral structure size of the pits generated in this
step is in the ten-micrometre range. Accordingly, no high-resolution structuring process
is required here.


*2: Lithography for lateral structuring*

A photoresist is applied to the wafer to generate a useful pattern of pits etched partly
into the stem:["SiO"_2] layer. In the exposed (optical or e-beam lithography) areas, the
thermal oxide layer is removed by reactive ion etching, leaving a very thin oxide layer
(stem:[t = 1 ... 5 "unitsml(nm)"]) at the bottom of the pits. The pit surrounding thick
stem:["SiO"_2] layer acts as a thermally protective layer to prevent stem:["Si"]
evaporation. At the bottom of the pit, which is free from oxygen, stem:["Si"] atoms can
diffuse to produce atomically smooth or terraced surfaces.

After the structuring of the wafer has been completed, it is assembled, since in the
subsequent UHV process only sample sizes of small dimensions, typically between stem:[5]
and stem:[10 "unitsml(mm)"], can be processed. In particular, the sawing of the wafer is
a considerable source of nanoparticulate impurities (essentially stem:["Si"]
nanoparticles (stem:["Si"]-NP)). Therefore, suitable measures (use of protective
varnish) must be taken before sawing to avoid a corresponding contamination of the
sample surface. Simple removal of the protective lacquer by dissolving it in acetone
leads to NP contamination again, as the stem:["Si"]-NP do not dissolve and subsequently
adhere to the stem:["Si"] surface again. An additional treatment of the sample in a
plasma asher before washing it in acetone is suitable to avoid the contamination from
sawing.


*3: Sample cleaning*

Immediately before the ready-made and structured sample blanks are transferred to the
UHV chamber, they are subjected to multi-stage cleaning in an ultrasonic bath. This
cleaning cycle starts with a bath for approx. 10 minutes in a basic cleaning solution,
followed by a short dip in deionized water and a two-minute bath in deionized water. The
final step is a two-minute bath in pure ethanol. All cleaning steps are carried out at
stem:[60 "unitsml(degC)"] with ultrasonic assistance.

This cleaning step achieves two objectives: 1.) During the storage of the sample
unavoidable contaminations (hydrocarbons etc.) are reduced as far as possible and 2.)
the stem:["SiO"_2] surface of the sample is preconditioned by immersion in a bath of the
basic cleaning solution in order to simplify the evaporation of this layer and the
release of stem:["Si"] atoms during the annealing process.


*4: Annealing under UHV conditions*

The stem:["Si"] sample is fixed on a tantalum holder and transferred into an UHV
chamber. After reaching a base pressure of better than stem:[1 xx 10^(-9)] mbar an
annealing process starts.

The sample can be heated with e.g. an electron beam heater (as shown in the example
(<<fig-6>>b)). The required heating power is applied to the back of the sample with an
electron beam. With this type of heating, however, structure formation on both sides is
not possible. Alternatively, a direct current heating can also be carried out, in which
the required heating power is transferred by a current flowing transversal through the
sample. In this case, it is also possible to generate atomic steps on the top and bottom
of the sample.

A typical temperature profile is shown in <<fig-7>>. There are three regions which are
important for further cleaning, removing of the residual thin oxide layer at the bottom
of the cavities (1), flattening
of oxygen free region by diffusion (2), and last but not the least a carefully
transition from the high-temperature stem:[1 xx 1] phase to the stem:[7 xx 7] structure
at around stem:[850 "unitsml(degC)"] (3).


[[fig-7]]
.Schematic of the temperature profile for annealing stem:["Si"] samples. The first temperature ramp is a further cleaning step in which the sample is cleaned of remaining foreign atoms (1). While holding the sample at approx. stem:[900 "unitsml(degC)"] (section 2), the stem:["Si"] surface lattice is reconstructed into a stem:[7 xx 7] structure. In the course of the last temperature ramp, the terraces or atomically smooth areas are formed by self-organization (3).
image::fig7.png[]


First, a further cleaning of the sample is achieved by two temperature steps. One at
stem:[~600 "unitsml(degC)"] to remove water from the surface, and a temperature ramp up
to stem:[T ~~ 1200 "unitsml(degC)"] to remove the residual thin oxide layer (sublimation
of stem:["SiO"] in high vacuum) at the bottom of the produced cavities. It is important
that during these steps the pressure remains below stem:[1 xx 10^(-9) "unitsml(mbar)"],
otherwise residual hydrocarbons can contaminate the silicon surface and distort the
needed diffusion process. In the second section, the sample is kept at a constant
temperature of approximately stem:[900 "unitsml(degC)"] for several hours to allow
stem:["Si"] atoms to diffuse on the surface and to smooth the originally rough silicon
surface at the bottom of the cavities. In the third phase the sample is cooled down.
Here an important point is to do this slowly enough at approximately stem:[850
"unitsml(degC)"] where the high temperature "stem:[1 xx 1]" phase changes to the stable
stem:[7 xx 7] phase <<lin>>. If this cooling is too fast the remaining "stem:[1 xx 1]"
phase areas show a different height compared to the stem:[7 xx 7] regions. This height
change can be detected by a high resolution AFM scan but will influence a step height
calibration. Other deviations which are caused by wrong annealing are meander like
structures and in some cases, chains of silicon atoms lying on the surface. Whereas the
first has an effect on step height calibration, the effect due to the latter is
insignificantly small.

Such carefully prepared stem:["Si"] samples and their monoatomic steps can be used
directly in UHV for calibration of an AFM and for STM with precise positioning control.


*5: Optical inspection and use in air*

In the case of an outward transfer of the sample to air, the sample will be brought by
transfer chambers in which dry nitrogen is used to interact with the pure stem:["Si"]
surface. During the transfer time a native oxide layer is grown which protects the
stem:["Si"]. With a thickness of stem:[1]-stem:[2 "unitsml(nm)"], this oxide layer is
sufficiently thin and at the same time homogeneous to maintain the structure of atomic
steps generated earlier. It also stabilizes the samples in the long term. Sample
stability over several months was demonstrated, individual samples produced at the
Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) could even be successfully stored over
several years for their use <<yacoot>>. However, during storage care should be taken to
avoid contamination of the surface.

In air confocal laser scanning microscopy can be used to detect the monoatomic steps and
to indicate cavities with appropriate structures for the calibration (see <<fig-6>>c).
At the bottom of the pits, areas with atomically smooth regions, staircases or
amphitheatre-like arrangement of steps can typically be obtained. Details are described
in <<busch>>.


=== Use of monoatomic stem:["Si"] steps for the calibration of instruments

Metrological investigations of stem:["Si"] steps are mainly done in air, because the
metrology instruments are usually not compatible with UHV conditions. However, during
the EMRP project "`Crystal`" the PTB started to equip a UHV-STM with a high resolution
interferometer for traceable investigations of surfaces under UHV conditions <<yacoot>>.

For the analysis of the steps it is necessary to differentiate between the staircase and
the amphitheatre arrangement of monoatomic steps. Garnaes _et al._ could show that in
the case of a low number of steps (stem:[~ 5 - 7]) the amphitheatre arrangement has some
advantages <<garnaes>>. Therefore, we present a more detailed analysis procedure for the
amphitheatre arrangement in this guide. Improved instruments and a high number of steps
are helpful to reduce the claimed uncertainty for monoatomic steps.


. Staircase arrangement of steps
+
--
The first investigations by metrological AFM in air were made on single-sided atomic
steps (<<fig-2>> and <<fig-3>>) combined with small terraces, only <<tsai>> <<fu>>.
However, the length of the terraces used was less than stem:[100 "unitsml(nm)"],
therefore the determination of the step height critically depends on the guidance
deviation of the instruments and on the base length of the stem:["Si"] terraces between
monoatomic steps, and the used algorithms. The measured step height values are close to
stem:[d_(111) = 0.313 "unitsml(nm)"] with a small measurement uncertainty. However, most
of the steps are limited to small terrace lengths, _i.e._ stem:[30 "unitsml(nm)"] to
stem:[100 "unitsml(nm)"], which is too small to be useful for other instruments than
AFM, _e.g._ optical microscopes. Furthermore it is necessary to apply a correction to
take into account any tilt of the steps. This is much easier with larger terraces and
amphitheatre like structures described below. Details necessary for the analysis and use
of the stem:["Si"] step heights in <<table-1>> are given in <<yacoot>>.

. Amphitheatre arrangement of steps
+

In this case the symmetrical analysis routines described in <<iso5436>> and <<iso25178>>
can be applied. An example is shown in <<fig-8>>.

The image shows on both sides of a flat inner part a monoatomic step and terrace. The
line sections superimposed on the profile in <<fig-8>> shows which parts of the profile
are used for the analysis: the part in the flat region at the centre of the bottom and
the parts at the terraces of the monoatomic steps. The transition range is excluded. The
large terraces in the micrometre range generated by the procedure described above are
advantageous for an improved averaging of data of the same level. Such large smooth
regions can thus be used to show deviations of the scanning instrument on a nano- and
sub-nanometre scale.

Typical scanning systems based on piezoelectric actuators show deviation due to
non-ideal behaviour of the actuator. Although systems with additional position control
and feedback systems offer improved positioning control, they still show position errors
due to pitch, yaw and roll errors <<klapetek>>. Furthermore, all positioning systems
including laser interferometer control show deviations from linearity, _i.e._
non-linearity effects. Additional deviations are caused by fluctuations in environmental
conditions. In the case of sophisticated instruments, such deviations can be in the
sub-nanometre range, but can be detected on the smooth regions of a large step-free
crystalline surface. Due to the properties of the bonding of atoms it can be assumed
that over regions of stem:[100 "unitsml(um)"] such a surface should be flat and any
deviation from flatness will be much smaller than deviations of current scanning systems
or positioning controls. Therefore, the calibration procedure for small step height
should include detection scanner deviation during the procedure to allow a good
calibration. However, if the deviations of the scanning system are too big, _i.e._ in
the nanometre range or if the deviations are not stable, a calibration of the vertical
axis using the silicon steps is not helpful.

J.{nbsp}Garneas _et al._ <<garnaes>> has used an amphitheatre-like structure to
determine the deviation of the scanner and has fitted the deviation by a polynomial of
second and higher order. <<fig-10>> shows results of this analysis.


[[fig-10]]
.Use of a polynomial fit to correct for scanner deviations by J. Garnaes [to be published]. Here a polynomial of fourth order was sufficient. Result of 4th order: stem:[d_"cor" = (0.3137 +- 0.0038) "unitsml(nm)"], that is, stem:[u(d_"cor") = 1.2 %].
image::fig9.png[]


Once the steps are localized, the height of the measured steps is estimated using a
least squares procedure. The latter assumes a model that aims to describe all the
features captured with the AFM, except the intrinsic noise of the measurement. The
well-known value of the lattice spacing associated with the step standards makes it
possible to establish a model with very well-defined properties:

* Atomic step heights are invariant, and thus, all the measured steps must have the same
height.

* Flat plateaus between steps. This means that any tilting in the measured profile comes
from incorrect leveling of the sample, contamination of the sample (e.g., oxide layers)
or nonlinearities of the microscope.

Based on these two properties, it is possible to formulate the following parametric model:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
hat y = nh + c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3 + ... + c_p x^p = nh + sum_{k=0}^p c_k x^k,
++++

where stem:[h] is the step height, stem:[n] is an integer that accounts for the jumps
between steps relative to the lowest plateau, and the polynomial with coefficients
stem:[c_k] accounts for other effects such as incorrect leveling of the sample and
nonlinearities of the microscope. The residual between the measured data and the model
is then defined as follows

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
ii(R)^2 = sum_{i=1}^ii(N) (y_i - hat y_i)^2,
++++

where stem:[ii(N)] is the total number of data points used in the fit. Note that model
points stem:[hat y_i] from different plateaus will have different values of stem:[n].
The edges between steps shall not be included in the fit, as they would increase the
highest order (stem:[p]) of the polynomial significantly. The least squares procedure
minimizes the sum of the residuals by solving the following equations:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
{del ii(R)^2} / {del h} = 2 sum_{i=1}^ii(N) (y_i - hat y_i) {del hat y_i} / {del h} = 2 (- sum_{i=1}^ii(N) y_i n_i + sum_{i=1}^ii(N) hat y_i n_i) = 0
++++

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
{del ii(R)^2} / {del c_k} = 2 sum_{i=1}^ii(N) (y_i - hat y_i) {del hat y_i} / {del c_k} = 2 (- sum_{i=1}^ii(N) y_i x_i^k + sum_{i=1}^ii(N) hat y_i x_i^k) = 0 " for " k = 0,1,2,...,p.
++++

This system of (stem:[p+2]) equations gives the best possible solution in a least
squares sense.

More information can be found in <<busch>>.

For the microscope used in his study, the artifacts could be estimated using a 4th order
polynomial or higher. Taking into consideration the theoretical value of a
stem:["Si(111)"] atomic step and using a fit percentage of 75%, the best results are
achieved with a 5th order polynomial, with a standard uncertainty of stem:[1
"unitsml(pm)"].


== Position Statement of CCL/WG-N

. CCL/WG-N believes that stem:["Si"] samples with large step-free areas and areas with
monoatomic steps and broad terraces are very useful for the detection of scanner
deviations and for the calibration of the vertical axis of instruments used for
applications in dimensional nanometrology.

. If monoatomic steps on stem:["Si"] samples are prepared in an appropriate manner the
vertical axis can be made traceable to the SI metre through reference values of the
silicon step height given in
<<table-1>>. Whereas, there is enough experience for the use of stem:["Si(111)"] and
stem:["Si(100)"] under UHV conditions and stem:["Si(111)"] in air, further experiments
on stem:["Si(100)"] in air are recommended.

. WG-N believes that for the step height value a larger uncertainty has to be used
instead of the very small uncertainty for bulk values. Reasons are related to unknown
stress or strain effects and due to unknown effects due to oxidation. The use of
improved instruments in future can lead to a further reduction of the stated uncertainty.

. WG-N has a responsibility to promote good measurement practice and SI traceability in
dimensional nanometrology and thus proposes, after further development of this document,
to issue a Recommendation to the Consultative Committee for Length (CCL).


== Recommendations of CCL/WG-N for use of flat and stepped silicon surfaces

The CCL/WG-N recommends the use of the silicon lattice parameter for the calibration of
the normal scan axes of high-resolution instruments in surface metrology. Depending on
their crystallographic orientation, the following values (see <<table-1,nopage%>>)
should be used for the distance between adjacent monoatomic steps.

The uncertainty given in the parenthesis is the expanded uncertainty (stem:[k = 2]).
Details about the sources of uncertainty are given <<garnaes>>.

The useful range of stem:["Si"] steps for the calibration of surface measuring
instruments is limited to heights below stem:[10 "unitsml(nm)"]. Further research in the
manufacturing processes of the monoatomic silicon step height standards might in future
allow to increase this calibration range and allow a further reduction of the
measurement uncertainty of monoatomic stem:["Si"] steps.
