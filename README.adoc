== Fetching the document

[source,sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/metanorma/bipm-si-brochure/
----


== Installing build tools

See https://www.metanorma.com/author/topics/install/


== Running via Docker or locally

If you have installed the build tools locally, and wish to run the
locally-installed compilation tools, there is nothing further to set.

If you don't want to deal with local dependencies, use the docker
version by:

[source,sh]
----
export METANORMA_DOCKER=metanorma/mn
----

The `Makefile` will automatically choose the proper command to
execute.


== Building the documents

Run the following commands to build the full collection of the documents.

[source,sh]
----
metanorma site generate .
metanorma collection si-brochure-bilingual.yml -x xml,html,presentation,pdf \
  -w bilingual-brochure -c sources/collection_cover.html
----

The following outputs will be built:

Component index:: `site/index.html`
Component outputs:: under `site/documents/` (HTML, PDF, MN S/P XML)
Bilingual brochure:: `bilingual-brochure/collection.{pdf,xml,presentation.xml}`
