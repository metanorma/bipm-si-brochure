== Fetching the document

[source,sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/metanorma/bipm-si-brochure/
----


== Installing build tools

See https://www.metanorma.org/install/


== Building the documents

Run the following commands to build the full collection of the documents.

[source,sh]

metanorma site generate --agree-to-terms
metanorma collection collection.yml
----

If you wish only to generate the bilingual SI Brochure, the following will
suffice. (the `brochure.yml` file does not compile any MEP documents)

=== Method 1: all in one

This method will generate the bilingual SI Brochure in one command.

[source,sh]
----
metanorma site generate -c brochure.yml --agree-to-terms
----

=== Method 2: individual document generation

This method generates the English and French SI Brochures separately, and
then combines them together into the bilingual version.

[source,sh]
----
metanorma sources/si-brochure-en.adoc
metanorma sources/si-brochure-fr.adoc
mkdir -p site/documents
mv sources/si-brochure-en.xml site/documents
mv sources/si-brochure-fr.xml site/documents
metanorma collection collection.yml
----

=== Outputs

The following outputs will be built:

Component index:: `site/index.html`
Component outputs:: under `site/documents/` (HTML, PDF, MN S/P XML)
Bilingual brochure:: `bilingual-brochure/collection.{pdf,xml,presentation.xml}`
