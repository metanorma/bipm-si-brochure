== Fetching the document

[source,sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/metanorma/bipm-si-brochure/
----


== Installing build tools

See https://www.metanorma.org/install/


== Building the documents

=== Full set

Run the following command to build the full collection of the documents.

[source,sh]
----
$ bundle exec metanorma site generate --agree-to-terms
----

=== SI Brochure

If you wish only to generate the bilingual SI Brochure, the following will
suffice. (the `brochure.yml` file does not compile any MEP documents)

.Compile document in single language
[source,sh]
----
$ bundle exec metanorma sources/si-brochure/3.01/si-brochure-en.adoc
----

.Compile collection with dual languages
[source,sh]
----
$ bundle exec metanorma collection --agree-to-terms sources/si-brochure/3.01/collection.yml
----


This method generates the English and French SI Brochures separately, and
then combines them together into the bilingual version.

[source,sh]
----
metanorma sources/si-brochure-en.adoc
metanorma sources/si-brochure-fr.adoc
mkdir -p _site/documents
mv sources/si-brochure-en.xml _site/documents
mv sources/si-brochure-fr.xml _site/documents
metanorma collection collection.yml
----

=== Outputs

The following outputs will be built:

Component index:: `_site/index.html`
Component outputs:: under `_site/documents/` (HTML, PDF, MN S/P XML)
Bilingual brochure:: `bilingual-brochure/collection.{pdf,xml,presentation.xml}`
